The decreased heart function can affect the lungs, liver, and other body systems. DCM is one of the cardiomyopathies, a group of diseases that affect primarily the heart muscle. Different cardiomyopathies have different causes and affect the heart in different ways. In DCM a portion of the myocardium is dilated, often without any obvious cause. Left or right ventricular systolic pump function of the heart is impaired, leading to progressive heart enlargement via ventricular hypertrophy and ventricular dilation, a process called ventricular remodeling. Dilated cardiomyopathy is the most common form of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy."}

Older, more established plants, usually at least 3 years in the ground, will grow faster than newly planted ones. Placement and care will influence how fast and tall a bamboo will grow.n general, bamboo will get as big as it can depending on how much space it has to grow, kind of like a goldfish in a goldfish bowl. If you want the bamboo to reach its full height, you need to be prepared to donate the space, an area at least 30 feet in circumference."}
