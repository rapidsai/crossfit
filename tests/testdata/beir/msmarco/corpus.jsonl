For prevention of rain-driven erosion, it is important to anchor the dirt down, such as with grass, or prevent water from collecting and picking up dirt as it flows down slope. A common way to prevent this is contour ploughing. What is... Making slopes into steps so that rain cannot run down a hill carrying soil off. When building terraces, it is important to stabilize the slope. -The easiest way to do this is to plant grass. If there is enough rock around it may be possible to construct a wall out of them.
