{"_id":"Adobe_Photoshop","title":"Adobe Photoshop","text":"Adobe Photoshop is a raster graphics editor developed and published by Adobe Systems for macOS and Windows .   Photoshop was created in 1988 by Thomas and John Knoll . Since then , it has become the de facto industry standard in raster graphics editing , such that the word `` photoshop '' has become a verb as in `` to Photoshop an image , '' `` photoshopping '' and `` photoshop contest '' , though Adobe discourages such use . It can edit and compose raster images in multiple layers and supports masks , alpha compositing and several color models including RGB , CMYK , CIELAB , spot color and duotone . Photoshop has vast support for graphic file formats but also uses its own PSD and PSB file formats which support all the aforementioned features . In addition to raster graphics , it has limited abilities to edit or render text , vector graphics ( especially through clipping path ) , 3D graphics and video . Photoshop 's feature set can be expanded by Photoshop plug-ins , programs developed and distributed independently of Photoshop that can run inside it and offer new or enhanced features .   Photoshop 's naming scheme was initially based on version numbers . However , in October 2002 , following the introduction of Creative Suite branding , each new version of Photoshop was designated with `` CS '' plus a number ; e.g. , the eighth major version of Photoshop was Photoshop CS and the ninth major version was Photoshop CS2 . Photoshop CS3 through CS6 were also distributed in two different editions : Standard and Extended . In June 2013 , with the introduction of Creative Cloud branding , Photoshop 's licensing scheme was changed to that of software as a service rental model and the `` CS '' suffixes were replaced with `` CC '' . Historically , Photoshop was bundled with additional software such as Adobe ImageReady , Adobe Fireworks , Adobe Bridge , Adobe Device Central and Adobe Camera RAW .   Alongside Photoshop , Adobe also develops and publishes Photoshop Elements , Photoshop Lightroom , Photoshop Express and Photoshop Touch . Collectively , they are branded as `` The Adobe Photoshop Family '' . It is currently a licensed software ."}

He played 22 seasons in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) for the Seattle Mariners , Texas Rangers , and New York Yankees . Rodriguez was one of the sport 's most highly touted prospects and is considered one of the greatest baseball players of all time . During his 22-year career , Rodriguez has amassed a .297 batting average , 696 home runs , over 2,000 runs batted in ( RBI ) , over 2,000 runs scored , and over 3,000 hits . He is a 14-time All-Star and has won three American League ( AL ) Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) Awards , ten Silver Slugger Awards , and two Gold Glove Awards . Rodr\u00edguez is the career record holder for grand slams with 25 . However , he has led a highly controversial career due to signing two of the most lucrative sports contracts in history while incurring criticism from the media for his behavior and use of illegal performance-enhancing drugs .   The Mariners selected Rodriguez first overall in the 1993 MLB draft , and he debuted in the major leagues the following year at the age of 18 . In 1996 , he became the Mariners ' starting shortstop and finished second in voting for the AL MVP Award . Rodriguez 's combination of power , speed , and defense made him a cornerstone of the franchise , but he left the team via free agency after the 2000 season to join the Rangers . The 10-year , $ 252 million contract he signed was the richest in baseball history . He played at a high level in his three years with Texas , highlighted by his first AL MVP Award win in 2003 , but the team failed to make the playoffs during his tenure . Prior to the 2004 season , Rodriguez was traded to the Yankees , for whom he converted to a third baseman due to incumbent shortstop Derek Jeter . In his first four seasons with New York , he was twice more named AL MVP . After opting out of his contract following the 2007 season , Rodriguez signed a new 10-year , $ 275 million deal with the Yankees , extending his record for the sport 's most lucrative contract . He became the youngest player ever to hit 500 home runs , reaching the milestone in 2007 . He won his first World Series in 2009 , which was the first year of the new Yankee Stadium . The following year , he became the career leader in home runs by a player of Hispanic descent . In recent years , Rodriguez has been hampered by hip and knee injuries , which have caused him to exclusively become a designated hitter . He played his final game as a Yankee on August 12 , 2016 .   In February 2009 , after previously denying use of performance-enhancing drugs , including during a 2007 interview with Katie Couric on 60 Minutes , Rodriguez admitted to using steroids , saying he used them from 2001 to 2003 when playing for Rangers due to `` an enormous amount of pressure '' to perform . While recovering from a hip injury in 2013 , Rodriguez made headlines by feuding with team management over his rehabilitation and for having allegedly obtained performance-enhancing drugs as part of the Biogenesis baseball scandal . In August 2013 , MLB suspended him 211 games for his involvement in the scandal , but he was allowed to play while appealing the punishment . Had the original suspension been upheld , it would have been the longest non-lifetime suspension in Major League Baseball history . After an arbitration hearing , the suspension was reduced to 162 games , keeping him off the field for the entire 2014 season ."}

With his distinctive raspy voice and a stage show that features guillotines , electric chairs , fake blood , deadly snakes , baby dolls , and dueling swords , Cooper is considered by music journalists and peers alike to be `` The Godfather of Shock Rock '' . He has drawn equally from horror films , vaudeville , and garage rock to pioneer a macabre and theatrical brand of rock designed to shock people .   Originating in Phoenix , Arizona , in the late 1960s after he moved from Detroit , Michigan , `` Alice Cooper '' was originally a band consisting of Furnier on vocals and harmonica , lead guitarist Glen Buxton , Michael Bruce on rhythm guitar , Dennis Dunaway on bass guitar , and drummer Neal Smith . The original Alice Cooper band released its first album in 1969 but broke into the international music mainstream with the 1971 hit `` I 'm Eighteen '' from their third studio album Love It to Death , which was followed by the even bigger single `` School 's Out '' in 1972 . The band reached their commercial peak with the 1973 album Billion Dollar Babies .   Furnier adopted the band 's name as his own name in the 1970s and began a solo career with the 1975 concept album Welcome to My Nightmare . In 2011 , he released Welcome 2 My Nightmare , his 19th album as a solo artist and 26th album in total . In 2011 , the original Alice Cooper band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . Expanding from his Detroit rock roots , Cooper has experimented with a number of musical styles , including art rock , hard rock , heavy metal , new wave , glam metal , pop rock , experimental rock , and industrial rock .   Cooper is known for his social and witty persona offstage , with The Rolling Stone Album Guide calling him the world 's most `` beloved heavy metal entertainer '' . He is credited with helping to shape the sound and look of heavy metal , and has been described as the artist who `` first introduced horror imagery to rock 'n' roll , and whose stagecraft and showmanship have permanently transformed the genre '' . Away from music , Cooper is a film actor , a golfing celebrity , a restaurateur , and , since 2004 , a popular radio DJ with his classic rock show Nights with Alice Cooper ."}

Long-term use can lead to alcohol abuse , physical dependence , and alcoholism .   Drinking alcohol plays an important social role in many cultures . Most countries have laws regulating their production , sale , and consumption ;  some countries ban such activities entirely . However , alcoholic drinks are legal in most parts of the world . The global alcoholic drink industry exceeded $ 1 trillion in 2014 .   Alcohol is one of the most widely used recreational drugs in the world . For instance , in 2015 , among Americans , 89 % of adults had consumed alcohol at some point , 70 % had drunk it in the last year , and 56 % in the last month . Alcoholic drinks are typically divided into three classes -- beers , wines , and spirits -- and typically contain between 3 % and 40 % alcohol by volume .   Discovery of late Stone Age jugs suggest that intentionally fermented drinks existed at least as early as the Neolithic period ( cir . 10,000 BC ) . Many nonhuman animals also consume alcohol when given the opportunity and are affected in much the same way as humans , although humans are the only species known to produce alcoholic drinks intentionally ."}

It premiered on October 7 , 2015 , and concluded January 13 , 2016 . The series was renewed in October 2014 , with the subtitle Hotel being announced in February 2015 . Hotel marks the first season to not feature series mainstays Jessica Lange and Frances Conroy . Returning cast from previous seasons of the series include : Evan Peters , Sarah Paulson , Denis O'Hare , Lily Rabe , Kathy Bates , Angela Bassett , Chlo\u00eb Sevigny , Finn Wittrock , Wes Bentley , Gabourey Sidibe , Mare Winningham , Matt Bomer , Christine Estabrook , Matt Ross , John Carroll Lynch , and Anthony Ruivivar , along with new cast members Lady Gaga and Cheyenne Jackson . Breaking from the anthological format , like Freak Show , the season is interconnected to the first and third seasons , and features an appearance by the Murder House , its original owner Dr. Charles Montgomery ( Ross ) , its realtor Marcy ( Estabrook ) , and the psychic Billie Dean Howard ( Paulson ) , as well as the appearance of the witch Queenie ( Sidibe ) .   The plot centers around the enigmatic Hotel Cortez in Los Angeles , California , that catches the eye of an intrepid homicide detective ( Bentley ) . The Cortez is host to the strange and bizarre , spearheaded by its owner , The Countess ( Gaga ) , who is a bloodsucking fashionista . The hotel is loosely based on an actual hotel built in 1893 by H. H. Holmes in Chicago , Il . for the 1893 World 's Columbian Exposition . It became known as the ` Murder Castle ' as it was built for Holmes to torture , murder , and dispose of evidence just as is the Cortez . This season features two murderous threats in the form of the Ten Commandments Killer , a serial offender who selects his victims in accordance with biblical teachings , and `` the Addiction Demon '' , who roams the hotel armed with a drill bit dildo .   According to creators Brad Falchuk and Ryan Murphy , thematically , Hotel is much darker than previous seasons . Inspiration came from old hotel horror films and actual hotels situated in downtown Los Angeles with a reputation for sinister events , including the Cecil . The cycle also marks a return to filming in Los Angeles , where the first two seasons were shot . Hotel features one of the most expansive sets in American Horror Story history , with production designer Mark Worthington building two stories on a soundstage , along with a working elevator and stairway . In July 2015 , FX launched a marketing campaign for the series , with most trailers and teasers touting Gaga 's involvement .   Although Hotel was originally reported to consist of thirteen episodes ( \u00e0 la Asylum , Coven , and Freak Show ) , that number was later revised to twelve ( \u00e0 la Murder House ) .

Sharing the bulk of the Southern Cone with its neighbor Chile to the west , the country is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north , Brazil to the northeast , Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east , and the Drake Passage to the south . With a mainland area of 2780400 km2 , Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world , the second largest in Latin America , and the largest Spanish-speaking one . The country is subdivided into twenty-three provinces ( provincias , singular provincia ) and one autonomous city ( ciudad aut\u00f3noma ) , Buenos Aires , which is the federal capital of the nation ( -LSB- Capital Federal , links = no -RSB- ) as decided by Congress .  The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions , but exist under a federal system .   Argentina claims sovereignty over part of Antarctica , the Falkland Islands ( -LSB- Islas Malvinas , links = no -RSB- ) , and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands . The earliest recorded human presence in the area of modern-day Argentina dates back to the Paleolithic period . The country has its roots in Spanish colonization of the region during the 16th century . Argentina rose as the successor state of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata , a Spanish overseas viceroyalty founded in 1776 . The declaration and fight for independence ( 1810 -- 1818 ) was followed by an extended civil war that lasted until 1861 , culminating in the country 's reorganization as a federation of provinces with Buenos Aires as its capital city . The country thereafter enjoyed relative peace and stability , with massive waves of European immigration radically reshaping its cultural and demographic outlook . The almost-unparalleled increase in prosperity led to Argentina becoming the seventh wealthiest developed nation in the world by the early 20th century .   After 1930 , Argentina descended into political instability and periodic economic crises that pushed it back into underdevelopment , though it nevertheless remained among the fifteen richest countries until the mid-20th century . Argentina retains its historic status as a middle power in international affairs , and is a prominent regional power in the Southern Cone and Latin America . Argentina has the second largest economy in South America , the third-largest in Latin America and is a member of the G-15 and G-20 major economies . It is also a founding member of the United Nations , World Bank , World Trade Organization , Mercosur , Union of South American Nations , Community of Latin American and Caribbean States and the Organization of Ibero-American States . It is the country with the second highest Human Development Index in Latin America with a rating of `` very high '' . Because of its stability , market size and growing high-tech sector , Argentina is classified as a high-income economy ."}
{"_id":"Arms_industry","title":"Arms industry","text":"The arms industry , also known as the defense industry or the arms trade , is a global industry responsible for the manufacturing and sales of weapons and military technology . It consists of a commercial industry involved in the research and development , engineering , production , and servicing of military material , equipment , and facilities . Arms-producing companies , also referred to as arms dealers , defense contractors , or as the military industry , produce arms for the armed forces of states and civilians . Departments of government also operate in the arms industry , buying and selling weapons , munitions and other military items . An arsenal is a place where arms and ammunition are made , maintained and repaired , stored , or issued , in any combination , whether privately or publicly owned . Products include guns , artillery , ammunition , missiles , military aircraft , military vehicles , ships , electronic systems , night vision devices , holographic weapon sights , laser rangefinders , laser sights , hand grenades , landmines and more . The arms industry also provides other logistical and operational support .   Stockholm International Peace Research Institute ( SIPRI ) estimated in 2012 that 2012 military expenditures were roughly 1.8 trillion United States dollars . This represents a relative decline from 1990 when military expenditures made up 4 % of world GDP . Part of the money goes to the procurement of military hardware and services from the military industry . The combined arms sales of the top 100 largest arms-producing companies amounted to an estimated $ 395 billion in 2012 according to SIPRI . In 2004 over $ 30 billion were spent in the international arms trade ( a figure that excludes domestic sales of arms ) . According to SIPRI , the volume of international transfers of major weapons in 2010 -- 14 was 16 per cent higher than in 2005 -- 2009 . The \ufb01ve biggest exporters in 2010 -- 2014 were the United States , Russia , China , Germany and France , and the \ufb01ve biggest importers were India , Saudi Arabia , China , the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan .   Many industrialized countries have a domestic arms-industry to supply their own military forces . Some countries also have a substantial legal or illegal domestic trade in weapons for use by its citizens , primarily for self-defense , hunting or sporting purposes . Illegal trade in small arms occurs in many countries and regions affected by political instability . The Small Arms Survey estimates that 875 million small arms circulate worldwide , produced by more than 1,000 companies from nearly 100 countries .   Contracts to supply a given country 's military are awarded by governments , making arms contracts of substantial political importance . The link between politics and the arms trade can result in the development of what U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower described as a military-industrial complex , where the armed forces , commerce , and politics become closely linked , similarly to the European multilateral defence procurement . Various corporations , some publicly held , others private , bid for these contracts , which are often worth many billions of dollars . Sometimes , as with the contract for the international Joint Strike Fighter , a competitive tendering process takes place , with the decision made on the merits of the designs submitted by the companies involved . Other times , no bidding or competition takes place ."}

Pirlo is usually deployed as a deep-lying playmaker in midfield for both his club and national sides , and he is widely regarded as one of the greatest ever exponents of this position , due to his vision , ball control , creativity and passing ability ; he is also a free-kick specialist .   Pirlo began his club career as an attacking midfielder with his home-town side Brescia , where he later helped the team to win the Serie B title and obtain Serie A promotion in 1997 . His promising performances led to a move to Internazionale in 1998 , but he struggled to gain playing time at his new club , due to his lack of pace , as well as heavy competition with other players in his position , and was subsequently sent on loan in 1999 . Despite successful spells with Reggina , and Brescia once again , Pirlo was still unable to break into Inter 's starting line-up , and was sold to cross-city rivals Milan in 2001 . At Milan , manager Carlo Ancelotti decided to shift Pirlo in front of the defence as a deep-lying playmaker , which allowed him more time on the ball to orchestrate his team 's attacks . Pirlo excelled in his new role , and soon developed into a world-class midfielder , playing a key role in Milan 's subsequent successes , as he won two UEFA Champions Leagues ( 2003 and 2007 ) , two UEFA Super Cups ( 2003 and 2007 ) , two Serie A titles ( 2004 and 2011 ) , a FIFA Club World Cup ( 2007 ) , a Supercoppa Italiana ( 2004 ) , and a Coppa Italia ( 2003 ) with the club .

It is the northernmost and westernmost of the 32 Federal Entities of Mexico . Before becoming a state in 1952 , the area was known as the North Territory of Baja California ( El Territorio Norte de Baja California ) . It has an area of 70113 km2 , or 3.57 % of the land mass of Mexico and comprises the northern half of the Baja California Peninsula , north of the 28th parallel , plus oceanic Guadalupe Island . The mainland portion of the state is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean , on the east by Sonora , the U.S. State of Arizona , and the Gulf of California ( also known as the `` Sea of Cortez '' ) , and on the south by Baja California Sur . Its northern limit is the U.S. state of California .   The state has an estimated population of 3,315,766 ( 2015 ) much more than the sparsely populated Baja California Sur to the south , and similar to San Diego County , California on its north . Over 75 % of the population lives in the capital city , Mexicali , in Ensenada , or in Tijuana . Other important cities include San Felipe , Rosarito and Tecate . The population of the state is composed of Mestizos , mostly immigrants from other parts of Mexico , and , as with most northern Mexican states , a large population of Mexicans of Spanish ancestry , and also a large minority group of East Asian , Middle Eastern and indigenous descent . Additionally , there is a large immigrant population from the United States due to its proximity to San Diego and the cheaper cost of living compared to San Diego . There is also a significant population from Central America . Many immigrants moved to Baja California for a better quality of life and the number of higher paying jobs in comparison to the rest of Mexico and Latin America .   Baja California is the twelfth largest state by area in Mexico . Its geography ranges from beaches to forests and deserts . The backbone of the state is the Sierra de Baja California , where the Picacho del Diablo , the highest point of the peninsula , is located . This mountain range effectively divides the weather patterns in the state . In the northwest , the weather is semi-dry and mediterranean . In the narrow center , the weather changes to be more humid due to altitude . It is in this area where a few valleys can be found , such as the Valle de Guadalupe , the major wine producing area in Mexico . To the east of the mountain range , the Sonoran Desert dominates the landscape . In the south , the weather becomes drier and gives way to the Vizcaino Desert . The state is also home to numerous islands off both of its shores . In fact , the westernmost point in Mexico , the Guadalupe Island , is part of Baja California . The Coronado , Todos Santos and Cedros Islands are also on the Pacific Shore . On the Gulf of California , the biggest island is the Angel de la Guarda , separated from the peninsula by the deep and narrow Canal de Ballenas ."}

Ascetics may withdraw from the world for their practices or continue to be part of their society , but typically adopt a frugal lifestyle , characterised by the renunciation of material possessions and physical pleasures , and time spent fasting while concentrating on the practice of religion or reflection upon spiritual matters .   Asceticism is classified into two types . `` Natural asceticism '' consists of a lifestyle where material aspects of life are reduced to utmost simplicity and a minimum but without maiming the body or harsher austerities that make the body suffer , while `` unnatural asceticism '' is defined as a practice that involves body mortification and self infliction of pain such as by sleeping on a bed of nails .   Asceticism has been historically observed in many religious traditions , including Buddhism , Christianity , Hinduism , Jainism and Judaism . Mainstream Islam has lacked asceticism , except for its minority Sufi sect whose long tradition has included strict asceticism . The practitioners of these religions eschewed worldly pleasures and led an abstinent lifestyle , in the pursuit of redemption , salvation or spirituality . Asceticism is seen in the ancient theologies as a journey towards spiritual transformation , where the simple is sufficient , the bliss is within , the frugal is plenty ."}

The dates of his rule are contemporary dates ; Augustus lived under two calendars , the Roman Republican until 45 BC , and the Julian after 45 BC . Due to departures from Julius Caesar 's intentions , Augustus finished restoring the Julian calendar in March AD 4 , and the correspondence between the proleptic Julian calendar and the calendar observed in Rome is uncertain before 8 BC . ( Blackburn & Holford-Strevens 2003 : 670 -- 1 )   He was born Gaius Octavius into an old and wealthy equestrian branch of the plebeian gens Octavia . His maternal great-uncle Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC , and Octavius was named in Caesar 's will as his adopted son and heir , then known as Octavianus ( Anglicized as Octavian ) . He , Mark Antony , and Marcus Lepidus formed the Second Triumvirate to defeat the assassins of Caesar . Following their victory at the Battle of Philippi , the Triumvirate divided the Roman Republic among themselves and ruled as military dictators.As part of the Triumvirate , Octavian ruled the Western provinces , Antony ruled the Eastern provinces , and Lepidus ruled Africa . The Triumvirate was eventually torn apart by the competing ambitions of its members . Lepidus was driven into exile and stripped of his position , and Antony committed suicide following his defeat at the Battle of Actium by Octavian in 31 BC .   After the demise of the Second Triumvirate , Augustus restored the outward fa\u00e7ade of the free Republic , with governmental power vested in the Roman Senate , the executive magistrates , and the legislative assemblies . In reality , however , he retained his autocratic power over the Republic as a military dictator . By law , Augustus held a collection of powers granted to him for life by the Senate , including supreme military command , and those of tribune and censor . It took several years for Augustus to develop the framework within which a formally republican state could be led under his sole rule . He rejected monarchical titles , and instead called himself Princeps Civitatis ( `` First Citizen of the State '' ) . The resulting constitutional framework became known as the Principate , the first phase of the Roman Empire .   The reign of Augustus initiated an era of relative peace known as the Pax Romana ( The Roman Peace ) . The Roman world was largely free from large-scale conflict for more than two centuries , despite continuous wars of imperial expansion on the Empire 's frontiers and the year-long civil war known as the `` Year of the Four Emperors '' over the imperial succession . Augustus dramatically enlarged the Empire , annexing Egypt , Dalmatia , Pannonia , Noricum , and Raetia ; expanding possessions in Africa ; expanding into Germania ; and completing the conquest of Hispania .   Beyond the frontiers , he secured the Empire with a buffer region of client states and made peace with the Parthian Empire through diplomacy . He reformed the Roman system of taxation , developed networks of roads with an official courier system , established a standing army , established the Praetorian Guard , created official police and fire-fighting services for Rome , and rebuilt much of the city during his reign .   Augustus died in AD 14 at the age of 75 . He probably died from natural causes , although there were unconfirmed rumors that his wife Livia poisoned him . He was succeeded as Emperor by his adopted son ( also stepson and former son-in-law ) Tiberius ."}

In December 1928 , Bhagat Singh and an associate , Shivaram Rajguru , fatally shot a 21-year-old British police officer , John Saunders , in Lahore , British India , mistaking Saunders , who was still on probation , for the British police superintendent , James Scott , whom they had intended to assassinate . They believed Scott was responsible for the death of popular Indian nationalist leader Lala Lajpat Rai , by having ordered a lathi charge in which Rai was injured , and , two weeks after which , died of a heart attack . Saunders was felled by a single shot from Rajguru , a marksman . He was then shot several times by Singh , the postmortem report showing eight bullet wounds . Another associate of Singh , Chandra Shekhar Azad , shot dead an Indian police constable , Chanan Singh , who attempted to pursue Singh and Rajguru as they fled .   After escaping , Singh and his associates , using pseudonyms , publicly owned to avenging Lajpat Rai 's death , putting up prepared posters , which , however , they had altered to show Saunders as their intended target . Singh was thereafter on the run for many months , and no convictions resulted at the time . Surfacing again in April 1929 , he and another associate , Batukeshwar Dutt , exploded two improvised bombs inside the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi . They showered leaflets from the gallery on the legislators below , shouted slogans , and then allowed the authorities to arrest them . The arrest , and the resulting publicity , had the effect of bringing to light Singh 's complicity in the John Saunders case . Awaiting trial , Singh gained much public sympathy after he joined fellow defendant Jatin Das in a hunger strike , demanding better prison conditions for Indian prisoners , and ending in Das 's death from starvation in September 1929 . Singh was convicted and hanged in March 1931 , aged 23 .   Bhagat Singh became a popular folk hero after his death . Jawaharlal Nehru wrote about him , `` Bhagat Singh did not become popular because of his act of terrorism but because he seemed to vindicate , for the moment , the honour of Lala Lajpat Rai , and through him of the nation . He became a symbol ; the act was forgotten , the symbol remained , and within a few months each town and village of the Punjab , and to a lesser extent in the rest of northern India , resounded with his name . '' In still later years , Singh , an atheist and socialist in life , won admirers in India from among a political spectrum that included both Communists and right-wing Hindu nationalists . Although many of Singh 's associates , as well as many Indian anti-colonial revolutionaries , were also involved in daring acts , and were either executed or died violent deaths , few came to be lionized in popular art and literature to the same extent as Singh ."}

It is bordered to the north and east by Brazil , to the southeast by Paraguay , to the south by Argentina , to the southwest by Chile , and to the northwest by Peru . One-third of the country is the Andean mountain range , with one of its largest cities and principal economic centers , El Alto , located on the Altiplano . Bolivia is one of two landlocked countries ( the other is Paraguay ) that lie outside Afro-Eurasia . Bolivia is geographically the largest landlocked country in the Americas , but remains a relatively small country in economic and military terms .   Before Spanish colonization , the Andean region of Bolivia was part of the Inca Empire , while the northern and eastern lowlands were inhabited by independent tribes . Spanish conquistadors arriving from Cuzco and Asunci\u00f3n took control of the region in the 16th century . During the Spanish colonial period Bolivia was administered by the Royal Audiencia of Charcas . Spain built its empire in great part upon the silver that was extracted from Bolivia 's mines .   After the first call for independence in 1809 , 16 years of war followed before the establishment of the Republic , named for Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar , on 6 August 1825 . Since independence , Bolivia has endured periods of political and economic instability , including the loss of various peripheral territories to its neighbors , such as Acre and parts of the Gran Chaco . It has been landlocked since the annexation of its Pacific coast territory by Chile following the War of the Pacific ( 1879 -- 84 ) , but agreements with neighboring countries have granted it indirect access to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans .   The country 's population , estimated at 11 million , is multiethnic , including Amerindians , Mestizos , Europeans , Asians and Africans . The racial and social segregation that arose from Spanish colonialism has continued to the modern era . Spanish is the official and predominant language , although 36 indigenous languages also have official status , of which the most commonly spoken are Guarani , Aymara and Quechua languages .   Modern Bolivia is constitutionally a unitary state , divided into nine departments . Its geography varies from the peaks of the Andes in the West , to the Eastern Lowlands , situated within the Amazon Basin . It is a developing country , with a medium ranking in the Human Development Index and a poverty level of 53 percent . Its main economic activities include agriculture , forestry , fishing , mining , and manufacturing goods such as textiles , clothing , refined metals , and refined petroleum . Bolivia is very wealthy in minerals , especially tin ."}

British Columbia is also a component of the Pacific Northwest and the Cascadia bioregion , along with the U.S. states of Idaho , Oregon , Washington , Alaska , and western Montana .   The first British settlement in the area was Fort Victoria , established in 1843 , which gave rise to the city of Victoria , at first the capital of the separate Colony of Vancouver Island . Subsequently , on the mainland , the Colony of British Columbia ( 1858 -- 66 ) was founded by Richard Clement Moody and the Royal Engineers , Columbia Detachment , in response to the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush . Moody was Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works for the Colony and the first Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia : he was hand-picked by the Colonial Office in London to transform British Columbia into the British Empire 's `` bulwark in the farthest west '' , and `` to found a second England on the shores of the Pacific '' . Moody selected the site for and founded the original capital of British Columbia , New Westminster , established the Cariboo Road and Stanley Park , and designed the first version of the Coat of arms of British Columbia . Port Moody is named after him .   In 1866 , Vancouver Island became part of the colony of British Columbia , and Victoria became the united colony 's capital . In 1871 , British Columbia became the sixth province of Canada . Its Latin motto is Splendor sine occasu ( `` Splendour without Diminishment '' ) .   The capital of British Columbia remains Victoria , the fifteenth-largest metropolitan region in Canada , named for the Queen who created the original European colonies . The largest city is Vancouver , the third-largest metropolitan area in Canada , the largest in Western Canada , and the third-largest in the Pacific Northwest . In October 2013 , British Columbia had an estimated population of 4,606,371 ( about 2.5 million of whom were in Greater Vancouver ) . The province is currently governed by the BC Liberal Party , led by Premier Christy Clark , who became leader as a result of a leadership convention vote on February 26 , 2011 , and who led her party to an election victory on May 14 , 2013 .   British Columbia evolved from British possessions that were established in what is now British Columbia by 1871 . First Nations , the original inhabitants of the land , have a history of at least 10,000 years in the area . Today there are few treaties and the question of Aboriginal Title , long ignored , has become a legal and political question of frequent debate as a result of recent court actions . Notably , the Tsilhqot ` in Nation has established Aboriginal title to a portion of their territory , as a result of the recent Supreme Court of Canada decision ( William -LSB- Tsilhqot ` in Nation -RSB- v. British Columbia ) .   BC 's economy is diverse , with service producing industries accounting for the largest portion of the province 's GDP . It is the endpoint of transcontinental railways , and the site of major Pacific ports that enable international trade . Though less than 5 % of its vast 944735 km2 land is arable , the province is agriculturally rich ( particularly in the Fraser and Okanagan valleys ) , because of milder weather near the coast and in certain sheltered southern valleys . Its climate encourages outdoor recreation and tourism , though its economic mainstay has long been resource extraction , principally logging , farming , and mining . Vancouver , the province 's largest city and metropolitan area , also serves as the headquarters of many western-based natural resource companies . It also benefits from a strong housing market and a per capita income well above the national average . While the coast of British Columbia and certain valleys in the south-central part of the province have mild weather , the majority of its land mass experiences a cold-winter-temperate climate similar to that of the rest of Canada . The Northern Interior region has a subarctic climate with very cold winters . The climate of Vancouver is by far the mildest winter climate of the major Canadian cities , with nighttime January temperatures averaging above the freezing point ."}

Although the name `` chimpanzee '' is sometimes used to refer to both species together , it is usually understood as referring to the common chimpanzee , whereas Pan paniscus is usually referred to as the bonobo .   The bonobo is distinguished by relatively long legs , pink lips , dark face and tail-tuft through adulthood , and parted long hair on its head . The bonobo is found in a 500000 km2 area of the Congo Basin in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Central Africa . The species is omnivorous and inhabits primary and secondary forests , including seasonally inundated swamp forests . Political instability in the region and the timidity of bonobos has meant there has been relatively little field work done observing the species in its natural habitat .   Along with the common chimpanzee , the bonobo is the closest extant relative to humans . Because the two species are not proficient swimmers , the formation of the Congo River 1.5 -- 2 million years ago possibly led to the speciation of the bonobo . Bonobos live south of the river , and thereby were separated from the ancestors of the common chimpanzee , which live north of the river . There is no concrete data on population numbers , but the estimate is between 29,500 and 50,000 individuals . The species is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List and is threatened by habitat destruction and human population growth and movement , though commercial poaching is the most prominent threat . They typically live 40 years in captivity ; their lifespan in the wild is unknown . As of June 2016 a total of 119 live in zoos across Europe ; 65 distributed between six different German zoos , and a further 54 in zoos in Belgium , France , the Netherlands and England ."}

He is best known for his pioneering work in rock , ambient , pop , and electronic music . A self-described `` non-musician '' , Eno has helped to introduce a variety of unique conceptual approaches and recording techniques into contemporary music , advocating a methodology of `` theory over practice '' throughout his career . He has been described as one of popular music 's most influential and innovative figures .   Born in Suffolk , Eno studied painting and experimental music at art school in the late 1960s before joining glam rock group Roxy Music as synthesizer player in 1971 . After recording two albums with the band , he departed in 1973 to record a number of solo albums , contributing to and ultimately coining the concept of ambient music with works such as Another Green World ( 1975 ) , Discreet Music ( 1975 ) , and Music for Airports ( 1978 ) . He took part in frequent collaborations with artists such as Robert Fripp , Harold Budd , Cluster , David Bowie on his `` Berlin Trilogy '' , and David Byrne on 1981 's My Life in the Bush of Ghosts . During the 1970s , Eno would also begin a parallel career as a producer , which included work on albums by Talking Heads and Devo , the no wave compilation No New York ( 1978 ) , and recordings by avant-garde artists such as John Cale , Jon Hassell , Laraaji , and Harold Budd , among others .   In subsequent decades , Eno continued to record solo albums , collaborate , and produce for other artists , including U2 , Coldplay , Laurie Anderson , James , Grace Jones , and Slowdive . Dating back to his time as a student , he has also pursued a variety of multimedia projects in parallel with his music career , including sound installations and his mid-70s co-development of Oblique Strategies , a deck of cards featuring cryptic aphorisms  intended to spur creative thinking . He continues to release music , produce , and write , and maintains a regular column in Prospect Magazine ."}

{"_id":"Cerebral_palsy","title":"Cerebral palsy","text":"Cerebral palsy ( CP ) is a group of permanent movement disorders that appear in early childhood . Signs and symptoms vary among people . Often , symptoms include poor coordination , stiff muscles , weak muscles , and tremors . There may be problems with sensation , vision , hearing , swallowing , and speaking . Often babies with cerebral palsy do not roll over , sit , crawl , or walk as early as other children of their age . Other symptoms include seizures and problems with thinking or reasoning , each of which occurs in about one third of people with CP . While the symptoms may get more noticeable over the first few years of life , the underlying problems do not worsen over time .   Cerebral palsy is caused by abnormal development or damage to the parts of the brain that control movement , balance , and posture . Most often the problems occur during pregnancy ; however , they may also occur during childbirth , or shortly after birth . Often the cause is unknown . Risk factors include preterm birth , being a twin , certain infections during pregnancy such as toxoplasmosis or rubella , exposure to methylmercury during pregnancy , a difficult delivery , and head trauma during the first few years of life , among others . About 2 % of cases are believed to be due to an inherited genetic cause . A number of sub-types are classified based on the specific problems present . For example , those with stiff muscles have spastic cerebral palsy , those with poor coordination have ataxic cerebral palsy , and those with writhing movements have athetoid cerebral palsy . Diagnosis is based on the child 's development over time . Blood tests and medical imaging may be used to rule out other possible causes .   CP is partly preventable through immunization of the mother and efforts to prevent head injuries in children such as through improved safety . There is no cure for CP ; however , supportive treatments , medications , and surgery may help many individuals . This may include physical therapy , occupational therapy , and speech therapy . Medications such as diazepam , baclofen , and botulinum toxin may help relax stiff muscles . Surgery may include lengthening muscles and cutting overly active nerves . Often external braces and other assistive technology are helpful . Some affected children can achieve near normal adult lives with appropriate treatment . While alternative medicines are frequently used there is no evidence to support their use .   CP is the most common movement disorder in children . It occurs in about 2.1 per 1,000 live births . Cerebral palsy has been documented throughout history with the first known descriptions occurring in the work of Hippocrates in the 5th century BCE . Extensive study of the condition began in the 19th century by William John Little , after whom spastic diplegia was called `` Little disease '' . William Osler first named it `` cerebral palsy '' from the German `` zerebrale Kinderl\u00e4hmung '' ( cerebral child-paralysis ) . A number of potential treatments are being examined , including stem cell therapy . However , more research is required to determine if it is effective and safe ."}
{"_id":"Chile","title":"Chile","text":"Chile , is a South American country occupying a long , narrow strip of land between the Andes to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west . It borders Peru to the north , Bolivia to the northeast , Argentina to the east , and the Drake Passage in the far south . Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fern\u00e1ndez , Salas y G\u00f3mez , Desventuradas , and Easter Island in Oceania . Chile also claims about 1250000 km2 of Antarctica , although all claims are suspended under the Antarctic Treaty .   The arid Atacama Desert in northern Chile contains great mineral wealth , principally copper . The relatively small central area dominates in terms of population and agricultural resources , and is the cultural and political center from which Chile expanded in the late 19th century when it incorporated its northern and southern regions . Southern Chile is rich in forests and grazing lands , and features a string of volcanoes and lakes . The southern coast is a labyrinth of fjords , inlets , canals , twisting peninsulas , and islands .   Spain conquered and colonized Chile in the mid-16th century , replacing Inca rule in northern and central Chile , but failing to conquer the independent Mapuche who inhabited south-central Chile . After declaring its independence from Spain in 1818 , Chile emerged in the 1830s as a relatively stable authoritarian republic . In the 19th century , Chile saw significant economic and territorial growth , ending Mapuche resistance in the 1880s and gaining its current northern territory in the War of the Pacific ( 1879 -- 83 ) after defeating Peru and Bolivia . In the 1960s and 1970s the country experienced severe left-right political polarization and turmoil . This development culminated with the 1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat that overthrew Salvador Allende 's democratically elected left-wing government and instituted a 16-year-long right-wing military dictatorship that left more than 3,000 people dead or missing . The regime , headed by Augusto Pinochet , ended in 1990 after it lost a referendum in 1988 and was succeeded by a center-left coalition which ruled through four presidencies until 2010 .   Chile is today one of South America 's most stable and prosperous nations . It leads Latin American nations in rankings of human development , competitiveness , income per capita , globalization , state of peace , economic freedom , and low perception of corruption . It also ranks high regionally in sustainability of the state , and democratic development . Chile is a founding member of the United Nations , the Union of South American Nations ( UNASUR ) and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States ( CELAC ) ."}

Charles was born at Buckingham Palace as the first grandchild of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth . He was educated at Cheam and Gordonstoun Schools , which his father , Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh , had attended as a child , as well as the Timbertop campus of Geelong Grammar School in Victoria , Australia . After earning a bachelor of arts degree from Trinity College , Cambridge , Charles served in the Royal Navy from 1971 to 1976 .

He united much of Europe during the early Middle Ages . He was the first recognised emperor in western Europe since the fall of the Western Roman Empire three centuries earlier . The expanded Frankish state that Charlemagne founded was called the Carolingian Empire .   Charlemagne was the oldest son of Pepin the Short and Bertrada of Laon . He became king in 768 following his father 's death , initially as co-ruler with his brother Carloman I. Carloman 's sudden death in 771 in unexplained circumstances left Charlemagne as the undisputed ruler of the Frankish Kingdom . He continued his father 's policy towards the papacy and became its protector , removing the Lombards from power in northern Italy and leading an incursion into Muslim Spain . He campaigned against the Saxons to his east , Christianising them upon penalty of death and leading to events such as the Massacre of Verden . Charlemagne reached the height of his power in 800 when he was crowned Emperor of the Romans by Pope Leo III on Christmas Day at Old St. Peter 's Basilica .   Charlemagne has been called the `` Father of Europe '' ( Pater Europae ) , as he united most of Western Europe for the first time since the Roman Empire . His rule spurred the Carolingian Renaissance , a period of energetic cultural and intellectual activity within the Western Church . All Holy Roman Emperors considered their kingdoms to be descendants of Charlemagne 's empire , up to the last Emperor Francis II and the French and German monarchies .   However , the Eastern Orthodox Church views Charlemagne more controversially , labelling as heterodox his support of the filioque and recognition by the Bishop of Rome as legitimate Roman Emperor , rather than recognising Irene of Athens of the Eastern Roman Empire . These and other machinations led to the eventual split of Rome and Constantinople in the Great Schism of 1054 .   Charlemagne died in 814 , having ruled as emperor for thirteen years . He was laid to rest in his imperial capital of Aachen in what is today Germany . He married at least four times and had three legitimate sons , but only his son Louis the Pious survived to succeed him ."}

Bradman 's career Test batting average of 99.94 is often cited as the greatest achievement by any sportsman in any major sport .   The story that the young Bradman practised alone with a cricket stump and a golf ball is part of Australian folklore . Bradman 's meteoric rise from bush cricket to the Australian Test team took just over two years . Before his 22nd birthday , he had set many records for top scoring , some of which still stand , and became Australia 's sporting idol at the height of the Great Depression .   During a 20-year playing career , Bradman consistently scored at a level that made him , in the words of former Australia captain Bill Woodfull , `` worth three batsmen to Australia '' . A controversial set of tactics , known as Bodyline , was specifically devised by the England team to curb his scoring . As a captain and administrator , Bradman was committed to attacking , entertaining cricket ; he drew spectators in record numbers . He hated the constant adulation , however , and it affected how he dealt with others . The focus of attention on his individual performances strained relationships with some team-mates , administrators and journalists , who thought him aloof and wary . Following an enforced hiatus due to the Second World War , he made a dramatic comeback , captaining an Australian team known as `` The Invincibles '' on a record-breaking unbeaten tour of England .   A complex , highly driven man , not given to close personal relationships ,  Bradman retained a pre-eminent position in the game by acting as an administrator , selector and writer for three decades following his retirement . Even after he became reclusive in his declining years his opinion was highly sought , and his status as a national icon was still recognised -- more than 50 years after his retirement as a Test player , in 2001 , Prime Minister John Howard of Australia called him the `` greatest living Australian '' . Bradman 's image has appeared on postage stamps and coins , and a museum dedicated to his life was opened while he was still living . On the centenary of his birth , 27 August 2008 , the Royal Australian Mint issued a $ 5 commemorative gold coin with Bradman 's image . In 2009 , he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame ."}

{"_id":"Dub_music","title":"Dub music","text":"Dub is a genre of music that grew out of reggae in the 1960s , and is commonly considered a subgenre , though it has developed to extend beyond the scope of reggae . Music in this genre consists predominantly of instrumental remixes of existing recordings and is achieved by significantly manipulating and reshaping the recordings , usually by removing the vocals from an existing music piece , and emphasizing the drum and bass parts ( this stripped-down track is sometimes referred to as a riddim ) . Other techniques include dynamically adding extensive echo , reverb , panoramic delay , and occasional dubbing of vocal or instrumental snippets from the original version or other works . It was an early form of popular electronic music .   Dub was pioneered by Osbourne `` King Tubby '' Ruddock , Lee `` Scratch '' Perry , Errol Thompson and others in the late 1960s . Augustus Pablo is credited with bringing the melodica to dub , and is also among the pioneers and creators of the genre . Similar experiments with recordings at the mixing desk outside of the dancehall environment were also done by producers Clive Chin and Herman Chin Loy . These producers , especially Ruddock and Perry , looked upon the mixing console as an instrument , manipulating tracks to come up with something new and different .  Dub has influenced many genres of music , including rock ( most significantly the subgenre of post-punk and other kinds of punk ) , pop , hip hop , disco , and later house , techno , ambient , electronic dance music , and trip hop . Dub has become a basis for the genres of jungle and drum and bass Traditional dub has survived , and some of the originators , such as Lee `` Scratch '' Perry and Mad Professor , continue to produce new material ."}

He attained the rank of field marshal .   Born into an aristocratic Prussian family with a long history of military service , Manstein joined the army at a young age and saw service on Western Front and Eastern Front during the First World War ( 1914 -- 18 ) . He rose to the rank of captain by the end of the war and was active in the inter-war period helping Germany rebuild her armed forces . In September 1939 , during the invasion of Poland at the beginning of the Second World War , he was serving as Chief of Staff to Gerd von Rundstedt 's Army Group South . Adolf Hitler chose Manstein 's strategy for the invasion of France of May 1940 , a plan later refined by Franz Halder and other members of the OKH . Anticipating a firm Allied reaction should the main thrust of the invasion take place through the Netherlands , Manstein devised an innovative operation -- later known as the Sichelschnitt ( `` sickle cut '' ) -- that called for an attack through the woods of the Ardennes and a rapid drive to the English Channel , thus cutting off the French and Allied armies in Belgium and Flanders . Attaining the rank of general at the end of the campaign , he was active in the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 and the Siege of Sevastopol ( 1941 -- 1942 ) , and was promoted to field marshal on 1 July 1942 . He also participated in the Siege of Leningrad .   Germany 's fortunes in the war began to take an unfavourable turn later in 1942 , especially in the catastrophic Battle of Stalingrad , where Manstein commanded a failed relief effort ( `` Operation Winter Storm '' ) in December . Later known as the `` backhand blow '' , Manstein 's counteroffensive in the Third Battle of Kharkov ( February -- March 1943 ) regained substantial territory and resulted in the destruction of three Soviet armies and the retreat of three others . He was one of the primary commanders at the Battle of Kursk ( July -- August 1943 ) , one of the largest tank battles in history . His ongoing disagreements with Hitler over the conduct of the war led to his dismissal in March 1944 . He never obtained another command and was taken prisoner by the British in August 1945 , several months after Germany 's defeat .   Manstein gave testimony at the main Nuremberg trials of war criminals in August 1946 , and prepared a paper that , along with his later memoirs , helped cultivate the myth of a `` clean Wehrmacht '' -- the myth that the German armed forces were not culpable for the atrocities of the Holocaust . In 1949 he was tried in Hamburg for war crimes and was convicted on nine of seventeen counts , including the poor treatment of prisoners of war and failing to protect civilian lives in his sphere of operations . His sentence of eighteen years in prison was later reduced to twelve , and he served only four years before being released in 1953 . As a military advisor to the West German government in the mid-1950s , he helped re-establish the armed forces . His memoir , Verlorene Siege ( 1955 ) , translated into English as Lost Victories , was highly critical of Hitler 's leadership , and only dealt with the military aspects of the war , ignoring its political and ethical contexts . Manstein died in Munich in 1973 ."}

Historically , the English population is descended from several peoples -- the earlier Britons ( or Brythons ) and the Germanic tribes that settled in Britain following the withdrawal of the Romans , including Angles , Saxons , Jutes and Frisians . Collectively known as the Anglo-Saxons , they founded what was to become England ( from the Old English Englaland ) along with the later Danes , Normans and other groups . In the Acts of Union 1707 , the Kingdom of England was succeeded by the Kingdom of Great Britain . Over the years , English customs and identity have become fairly closely aligned with British customs and identity in general .   Today many English people have recent forebears from other parts of the United Kingdom , while some are also descended from more recent immigrants from other European countries and from the Commonwealth .   The English people are the source of the English language , the Westminster system , the common law system and numerous major sports such as cricket , football , rugby union , rugby league and tennis . These and other English cultural characteristics have spread worldwide , in part as a result of the former British Empire ."}
{"_id":"Electric_chair","title":"Electric chair","text":"Execution by electrocution , performed using an electric chair , is a method of execution originating in the United States in which the condemned person is strapped to a specially built wooden chair and electrocuted through electrodes fastened on the head and leg . This execution method , conceived in 1881 by a Buffalo , New York , dentist named Alfred P. Southwick , was developed throughout the 1880s as a humane alternative to hanging and first used in 1890 . This execution method has been used in the United States and , for a period of several decades , in the Philippines ( its first use there in 1924 , last in 1976 ) .   Historically , once the condemned person was attached to the chair , various cycles ( differing in voltage and duration ) of alternating current would be passed through the individual 's body , in order to cause fatal damage to the internal organs ( including the brain ) . The first more powerful jolt of electric current was designed to pass through the head and cause immediate unconsciousness and brain death . The second less powerful jolt was designed to cause fatal damage to the vital organs . Death may also be caused by electrical overstimulation of the heart .   Although the electric chair has long been a symbol of the death penalty in the United States , its use is in decline due to the rise of lethal injection , which is widely believed to be a more humane method of execution . Although some states still maintain electrocution as a method of execution , today it is only maintained as a secondary method that may be chosen over lethal injection at the request of the prisoner , except in Tennessee where it may be used if the drugs for lethal injection are not available , without input from the prisoner . As of 2014 , electrocution is an optional form of execution in Alabama , Florida , South Carolina and Virginia . They allow the prisoner to choose lethal injection as an alternative method . In the state of Kentucky the electric chair has been retired except for those whose capital crimes were committed prior to March 31 , 1998 , and who choose electrocution ; inmates who do not choose electrocution and inmates who committed their crimes after the designated date are executed by lethal injection . In the state of Tennessee the electric chair is available for use if lethal injection drugs are unavailable , or otherwise if the inmate so chooses if their capital crime was committed before 1999 . The electric chair is an alternate form of execution approved for potential use in Arkansas and Oklahoma if other forms of execution are found unconstitutional in the state at the time of execution . On February 8 , 2008 , the Nebraska Supreme Court determined that execution by electric chair was a `` cruel and unusual punishment '' under the state 's constitution . This brought executions of this type to an end in Nebraska , the only remaining state to retain electrocution as its sole method of execution ."}
{"_id":"Elizabeth_of_York","title":"Elizabeth of York","text":"Elizabeth of York ( 11 February 1466 -- 11 February 1503 ) was queen consort of England from 1486 until her death . As the wife of Henry VII , she was the first Tudor queen . She was the daughter of Edward IV and niece of Richard III , and she married the king following Henry 's victory at the Battle of Bosworth which started the last phase of the Wars of the Roses . She was the mother of King Henry VIII . Therefore , she was the daughter , sister , niece , wife , mother and grandmother of successive Kings of England .   The period of Henry VI 's readaption from October 1470 until April 1471 and the period between her father 's death in 1483 , when she was 17 , and the making of peace between her mother and her uncle Richard were violent and anxious interludes in what was mostly a peaceful life . Her two brothers disappeared , the `` Princes in the Tower '' , their fate unknown . She was welcomed back to court by her Uncle Richard III , along with all of her sisters . As a Yorkist princess , the final victory of the Lancastrian faction in the War of the Roses may have seemed a further disaster , but Henry Tudor knew the importance of Yorkist support for his invasion and promised to marry her before he arrived in England ; this was an important move , which , however , failed to bring him the desired Yorkist support .   Her marriage seems to have been successful , though her eldest son Arthur , Prince of Wales , died at age 15 in 1502 , and three other children died young . She seems to have played little part in politics . Her surviving children became a King of England and queens of France and Scotland ; it is through the Scottish Stuart dynasty that her many modern royal descendants trace their descent from her ."}

{"_id":"Exhumation_and_reburial_of_Richard_III_of_England","title":"Exhumation and reburial of Richard III of England","text":"The exhumation and reburial of Richard III began with the discovery of the king 's remains within the site of the former Greyfriars Friary Church in Leicester , England , in September 2012 . Following extensive anthropological and genetic testing , the remains of Richard III , the last English king killed in battle , were ultimately reinterred at Leicester Cathedral on 26 March 2015 .   Richard III , the final ruler of the Plantagenet dynasty , was killed on 22 August 1485 in the Battle of Bosworth Field , the last significant battle of the Wars of the Roses . His body was taken to Greyfriars Friary in Leicester , where it was buried in a crude grave in the friary church . Following the friary 's dissolution in 1538 and subsequent demolition , Richard 's tomb was lost . An erroneous account arose that Richard 's bones had been thrown into the River Soar at the nearby Bow Bridge .   A search for Richard 's body began in August 2012 , initiated by the Looking for Richard project with the support of the Richard III Society . The archaeological excavation was led by the University of Leicester Archaeological Services , working in partnership with Leicester City Council . On the first day a human skeleton belonging to a man in his thirties was uncovered showing signs of severe injuries . The skeleton , which had several unusual physical features , most notably a severe curvature of the back , was exhumed to allow scientific analysis . Examination showed that the man had probably been killed either by a blow from a large bladed weapon , probably a halberd , which cut off the back of his skull and exposed the brain , or by a sword thrust that penetrated all the way through the brain . Other wounds on the skeleton had probably occurred after death as `` humiliation injuries '' , inflicted as a form of posthumous revenge .   The age of the bones at death matched that of Richard when he was killed ; they were dated to about the period of his death and were mostly consistent with physical descriptions of the king . Preliminary DNA analysis showed that mitochondrial DNA extracted from the bones matched that of two matrilineal descendants , one 17th-generation and the other 19th-generation , of Richard 's sister Anne of York . Taking these findings into account along with other historical , scientific and archaeological evidence , the University of Leicester announced on 4 February 2013 that it had concluded beyond reasonable doubt that the skeleton was that of Richard III .   As a condition of being allowed to disinter the skeleton , the archaeologists agreed that , if Richard were found , his remains would be reburied in Leicester Cathedral . A controversy arose as to whether an alternative reburial site , York Minster or Westminster Abbey , would be more suitable . A legal challenge confirmed there were no public law grounds for the courts to be involved in that decision . Reinterment took place in Leicester on 26 March 2015 , during a televised memorial service held in the presence of the Archbishop of Canterbury and senior members of other Christian denominations ."}

He appeared in various musicals such as On the Town ( 1949 ) , Guys and Dolls ( 1955 ) , High Society ( 1956 ) , and Pal Joey ( 1957 ) , winning another Golden Globe for the latter .

DeMille Award in 1971 . On television , The Frank Sinatra Show began on ABC in 1950 , and he continued to make appearances on television throughout the 1950s and 1960s . Sinatra was also heavily involved with politics from the mid-1940s , and actively campaigned for presidents such as Harry S. Truman , John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan , though before Kennedy 's death Sinatra 's alleged Mafia connections led to his being snubbed .   While Sinatra never formally learned how to read music , he had an impressive understanding of it , and he worked very hard from a young age to improve his abilities in all aspects of music . A perfectionist , renowned for his dress sense and performing presence , he always insisted on recording live with his band . His bright blue eyes earned him the popular nickname `` Ol' Blue Eyes '' . Sinatra led a colorful personal life , and was often involved in turbulent affairs with women , such as with his second wife Ava Gardner . He went on to marry Mia Farrow in 1966 and Barbara Marx in 1976 . Sinatra had several violent confrontations , usually with journalists he felt had crossed him , or work bosses with whom he had disagreements . He was honored at the Kennedy Center Honors in 1983 , was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Ronald Reagan in 1985 , and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1997 . Sinatra was also the recipient of eleven Grammy Awards , including the Grammy Trustees Award , Grammy Legend Award and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award . After his death , American music critic Robert Christgau called him `` the greatest singer of the 20th century '' , and he continues to be seen as an iconic figure ."}

He was initially convicted of 48 separate murders and later confessed to nearly twice that number . As part of his plea bargain , an additional conviction was added , bringing the total number of convictions to 49 , making him the most prolific American serial killer in history according to confirmed murders . He murdered numerous women and girls in Washington State during the 1980s and 1990s . Most of his victims were alleged to be sex workers and other women in vulnerable situations , including underage runaways . The press gave him his nickname after the first five victims were found in the Green River before his identity was known . He strangled the women , usually by hand but sometimes using ligatures . After strangling them , he would dump their bodies in forested and overgrown areas in King County , often returning to the dead bodies to have sexual intercourse with them .   On November 30 , 2001 , as he was leaving the Kenworth truck factory where he worked in Renton , Washington , he was arrested for the murders of four women whose cases were linked to him through DNA evidence .

Signs and symptoms include some combination of diarrhea , vomiting , and abdominal pain . Fever , lack of energy , and dehydration may also occur . This typically lasts less than two weeks . It is unrelated to influenza though it has been called the `` stomach flu '' .   Gastroenteritis can be due to infections by viruses , bacteria , parasites , and fungus . The most common cause is viruses . In children rotavirus is the most common cause of severe disease . In adults , norovirus and Campylobacter are common . Transmission may occur due to eating improperly prepared foods , drinking contaminated water , or through close contact with an individual who is infected . Testing to confirm the diagnosis is typically not needed .   Prevention includes hand washing with soap , drinking clean water , proper disposal of human waste , and breastfeeding babies instead of using formula . The rotavirus vaccine is recommended in children . Treatment involves getting enough fluids . For mild or moderate cases , this can typically be achieved by drinking oral rehydration solution ( a combination of water , salts , and sugar ) . In those who are breast fed , continued breastfeeding is recommended . For more severe cases , intravenous fluids may be needed . Fluids may also be given by a nasogastric tube . Zinc supplementation is recommended in children . Antibiotics are generally not needed .   It is estimated that two billion cases of gastroenteritis resulted in 1.3 million deaths globally in 2015 . Children and those in the developing world are most commonly affected . As of 2011 , in those below age five , there were about 1.7 billion cases resulting in about 700,000 deaths . In the developing world children less than two years of age frequently get six or more infections a year . It is less common in adults , partly due to the development of immunity ."}

He was the last Emperor of India and the first Head of the Commonwealth .   Known as Albert until his accession , George VI was born in the reign of his great-grandmother Queen Victoria , and was named after his great-grandfather Albert , Prince Consort . As the second son of King George V , he was not expected to inherit the throne and spent his early life in the shadow of his elder brother , Edward . He attended naval college as a teenager , and served in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force during the First World War . In 1920 , he was made Duke of York . He married Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon in 1923 and they had two daughters , Elizabeth and Margaret . In the mid-1920s , he had speech therapy for a stammer , which he never fully overcame .   George 's elder brother ascended the throne as Edward VIII upon the death of their father in 1936 . However , later that year Edward revealed his desire to marry divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson . British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin advised Edward that for political and religious reasons he could not marry a divorced woman and remain king . Edward abdicated in order to marry , and George ascended the throne as the third monarch of the House of Windsor .   During George 's reign , the break-up of the British Empire and its transition into the Commonwealth of Nations accelerated . The parliament of the Irish Free State removed direct mention of the monarch from the country 's constitution on the day of his accession . The following year , a new Irish constitution changed the name of the state to Ireland and established the office of President . From 1939 , the Empire and Commonwealth -- except Ireland -- was at war with Nazi Germany . War with Italy and Japan followed in 1940 and 1941 , respectively . Though Britain and its allies were ultimately victorious in 1945 , the United States and the Soviet Union rose as pre-eminent world powers and the British Empire declined . After the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947 , George remained king of both countries , but relinquished the title of Emperor of India in June 1948 . Ireland formally declared itself a republic and left the Commonwealth in 1949 , and India became a republic within the Commonwealth the following year . George adopted the new title of Head of the Commonwealth . He was beset by health problems in the later years of his reign . He was succeeded by his eldest daughter , Elizabeth II ."}

It is contained within and managed by Grand Canyon National Park , the Kaibab National Forest , Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument , the Hualapai Tribal Nation , the Havasupai people and the Navajo Nation . President Theodore Roosevelt was a major proponent of preservation of the Grand Canyon area , and visited it on numerous occasions to hunt and enjoy the scenery .   The Grand Canyon is 277 mi long , up to 18 mi wide and attains a depth of over a mile ( 6093 ft ) . Nearly two billion years of Earth 's geological history have been exposed as the Colorado River and its tributaries cut their channels through layer after layer of rock while the Colorado Plateau was uplifted . While some aspects about the history of incision of the canyon are debated by geologists , several recent studies support the hypothesis that the Colorado River established its course through the area about 5 to 6 million years ago . Since that time , the Colorado River has driven the down-cutting of the tributaries and retreat of the cliffs , simultaneously deepening and widening the canyon .   For thousands of years , the area has been continuously inhabited by Native Americans , who built settlements within the canyon and its many caves . The Pueblo people considered the Grand Canyon a holy site , and made pilgrimages to it . The first European known to have viewed the Grand Canyon was Garc\u00eda L\u00f3pez de C\u00e1rdenas from Spain , who arrived in 1540 ."}

Guyana is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the north , Brazil to the south and southwest , Suriname to the east and Venezuela to the west . With 215000 sqkm , Guyana is the fourth-smallest country on mainland South America after Uruguay , Suriname and French Guiana ( an overseas region of France ) .   The region known as `` the Guianas '' consists of the large shield landmass north of the Amazon River and east of the Orinoco River known as the `` land of many waters '' . Originally inhabited by several indigenous groups , Guyana was settled by the Dutch before coming under British control in the late 18th century . It was governed as British Guiana , with mostly a plantation style economy until the 1950s . It gained independence in 1966 , and officially became a republic within the Commonwealth of Nations in 1970 .

It has the longest documented history of any living language , spanning 34 centuries of written records . Its writing system has been the Greek alphabet for the major part of its history ; other systems , such as Linear B and the Cypriot syllabary , were used previously . The alphabet arose from the Phoenician script and was in turn the basis of the Latin , Cyrillic , Armenian , Coptic , Gothic and many other writing systems .   The Greek language holds an important place in the history of the Western world and Christianity ; the canon of ancient Greek literature includes seminal works in the Western canon such as the epic poems Iliad and Odyssey . Greek is also the language in which many of the foundational texts in science , especially astronomy , mathematics and logic , and Western philosophy , such as the Platonic dialogues and the works of Aristotle , are composed ; the New Testament of the Christian Bible was written in Koin\u00e9 Greek . Together with the Latin texts and traditions of the Roman world , the study of the Greek texts and society of antiquity constitutes the discipline of Classics .   During antiquity , Greek was a widely spoken lingua franca in the Mediterranean world and many places beyond . It would eventually become the official parlance of the Byzantine Empire and develop into Medieval Greek . In its modern form , the Greek language is the official language in two countries , Greece and Cyprus , a recognised minority language in seven other countries , and is one of the 24 official languages of the European Union . The language is spoken by at least 13.2 million people today in Greece , Cyprus , Italy , Albania , Turkey , and the Greek diaspora .   Greek roots are often used to coin new words for other languages ; Greek and Latin are the predominant sources of international scientific vocabulary ."}

He is referred to as the `` Father of Modern Medicine '' in recognition of his lasting contributions to the field as the founder of the Hippocratic School of Medicine . This intellectual school revolutionized medicine in ancient Greece , establishing it as a discipline distinct from other fields with which it had traditionally been associated ( theurgy and philosophy ) , thus establishing medicine as a profession .   However , the achievements of the writers of the Corpus , the practitioners of Hippocratic medicine , and the actions of Hippocrates himself were often commingled ; thus very little is known about what Hippocrates actually thought , wrote , and did . Hippocrates is commonly portrayed as the paragon of the ancient physician , and credited with coining the Hippocratic Oath , still relevant and in use today .

{"_id":"Heart","title":"Heart","text":"The heart is a muscular organ in humans and other animals , which pumps blood through the blood vessels of the circulatory system . Blood provides the body with oxygen and nutrients , as well as assists in the removal of metabolic wastes . In humans , the heart is located between the lungs , in the middle compartment of the chest .   In humans , other mammals , and birds , the heart is divided into four chambers : upper left and right atria ; and lower left and right ventricles . Commonly the right atrium and ventricle are referred together as the right heart and their left counterparts as the left heart . Fish , in contrast , have two chambers , an atrium and a ventricle , while reptiles have three chambers . In a healthy heart blood flows one way through the heart due to heart valves , which prevent backflow . The heart is enclosed in a protective sac , the pericardium , which also contains a small amount of fluid . The wall of the heart is made up of three layers : epicardium , myocardium , and endocardium .   The heart pumps blood with a rhythm determined by a group of pacemaking cells in the sinoatrial node . These generate a current that causes contraction of the heart , traveling through the atrioventricular node and along the conduction system of the heart . The heart receives blood low in oxygen from the systemic circulation , which enters the right atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae and passes to the right ventricle . From here it is pumped into the pulmonary circulation , through the lungs where it receives oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide . Oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium , passes through the left ventricle and is pumped out through the aorta to the systemic circulation \u2212 where the oxygen is used and metabolized to carbon dioxide . The heart beats at a resting rate close to 72 beats per minute . Exercise temporarily increases the rate , but lowers resting heart rate in the long term , and is good for heart health .   Cardiovascular diseases ( CVD ) are the most common cause of death globally as of 2008 , accounting for 30 % of deaths . Of these more than three quarters are a result of coronary artery disease and stroke . Risk factors include : smoking , being overweight , little exercise , high cholesterol , high blood pressure , and poorly controlled diabetes , among others . Cardiovascular diseases frequently have no symptoms or may cause chest pain or shortness of breath . Diagnosis of heart disease is often done by the taking of a medical history , listening to the heart-sounds with a stethoscope , ECG , and ultrasound . Specialists who focus on diseases of the heart are called cardiologists , although many specialties of medicine may be involved in treatment ."}

It is the 4th generation of iPhone , succeeding the 3GS and preceding the 4S .   The iPhone 4 introduced a new hardware design to the iPhone family , which Apple 's CEO Steve Jobs touted as the thinnest smartphone in the world at the time ; it consisted of an uninsulated stainless steel frame which doubles as an antenna , with internal components situated between chemically strengthened aluminosilicate glass . The iPhone 4 also introduced Apple 's new high-resolution `` Retina Display '' ; while maintaining the same physical size and aspect ratio as its precursors , its liquid crystal display had a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch . The iPhone 4 also introduced Apple 's A4 system-on-chip , along with iOS 4 -- which notably introduced multitasking functionality and Apple 's new FaceTime video chat service . The iPhone 4 was also the first iPhone to include a front-facing camera , and the first to be released in a version for CDMA networks , ending AT&T 's period as the exclusive carrier of iPhone products in the United States .   It was succeeded as Apple 's flagship smartphone in 2011 by the iPhone 4S . However , iPhone 4 continued to be produced until 2013 .   The iPhone 4 received generally positive reception , with critics praising its revamped design and more powerful hardware in comparison to previous models . While it was a market success , with over 600,000 pre-orders within 24 hours , the release of the iPhone 4 was plagued by highly publicized reports that abnormalities in its new antenna design caused the device to lose its cellular signal if held in a certain way . Most human contact with the phone 's outer edge would cause a significant decrease in signal strength .   The iPhone 4 spent the longest time as Apple 's flagship iPhone model at fifteen months , and had the longest lifespan of any iPhone ever produced , spanning close to four years and available in some developing countries until early 2015 ."}

{"_id":"Horse","title":"Horse","text":"The horse ( Equus ferus caballus ) is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus . It is an odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family Equidae . The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature , Eohippus , into the large , single-toed animal of today . Humans began to domesticate horses around 4000 BC , and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC . Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated , although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses . These feral populations are not true wild horses , as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated , such as the endangered Przewalski 's horse , a separate subspecies , and the only remaining true wild horse . There is an extensive , specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts , covering everything from anatomy to life stages , size , colors , markings , breeds , locomotion , and behavior .   Horses ' anatomy enables them to make use of speed to escape predators and they have a well-developed sense of balance and a strong fight-or-flight response . Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait : horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down . Female horses , called mares , carry their young for approximately 11 months , and a young horse , called a foal , can stand and run shortly following birth . Most domesticated horses begin training under saddle or in harness between the ages of two and four . They reach full adult development by age five , and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30 years .   Horse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament : spirited `` hot bloods '' with speed and endurance ; `` cold bloods '' , such as draft horses and some ponies , suitable for slow , heavy work ; and `` warmbloods '' , developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods , often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes , particularly in Europe . There are more than 300 breeds of horse in the world today , developed for many different uses .   Horses and humans interact in a wide variety of sport competitions and non-competitive recreational pursuits , as well as in working activities such as police work , agriculture , entertainment , and therapy . Horses were historically used in warfare , from which a wide variety of riding and driving techniques developed , using many different styles of equipment and methods of control . Many products are derived from horses , including meat , milk , hide , hair , bone , and pharmaceuticals extracted from the urine of pregnant mares . Humans provide domesticated horses with food , water and shelter , as well as attention from specialists such as veterinarians and farriers ."}

{"_id":"Iceland","title":"Iceland","text":"Iceland ( -LSB- \u02c8a\u026asl\u0259nd -RSB- -LSB- \u02c8istlant -RSB- ) is a Nordic island country in the North Atlantic Ocean . It has a population of and an area of 103000 km2 , making it the most sparsely populated country in Europe . The capital and largest city is Reykjav\u00edk . Reykjav\u00edk and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population . Iceland is volcanically and geologically active . The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields , mountains and glaciers , while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands . Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate , despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle . Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly , with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate .   According to the ancient manuscript Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k , the settlement of Iceland began in the year 874 AD when the Norwegian chieftain Ing\u00f3lfr Arnarson became the first permanent settler on the island . In the following centuries , Norwegians , and to a lesser extent other Scandinavians , emigrated to Iceland , bringing with them thralls of Gaelic origin . The island was governed as an independent commonwealth under the Althing , one of the world 's oldest functioning legislative assemblies . Following a period of civil strife , Iceland acceded to Norwegian rule in the 13th century . The establishment of the Kalmar Union in 1397 united the kingdoms of Norway , Denmark and Sweden . Iceland thus followed Norway 's integration to that Union and came under Danish rule after Sweden 's secession from that union in 1523 . Although the Danish kingdom introduced Lutheranism forcefully in 1550 , Iceland remained a distant semi-colonial territory in which Danish institutions and infrastructures were conspicuous by their absence . In the wake of the French revolution and the Napoleonic wars , Iceland 's struggle for independence took form and culminated in independence in 1918 and the founding of a republic in 1944 . Until the 20th century , Iceland relied largely on subsistence fishing and agriculture , and was among the poorest in Europe . Industrialisation of the fisheries and Marshall Plan aid following World War II brought prosperity , and Iceland became one of the wealthiest and most developed nations in the world . In 1994 , it became a part of the European Economic Area , which further diversified the economy into sectors such as finance , biotechnology , and manufacturing .   Iceland has a market economy with relatively low taxes compared to other OECD countries . It maintains a Nordic social welfare system that provides universal health care and tertiary education for its citizens . Iceland ranks high in economic , political and social stability and equality . In 2013 , it was ranked as the 13th most-developed country in the world by the United Nations ' Human Development Index . Iceland runs almost completely on renewable energy . Affected by the ongoing worldwide financial crisis , the nation 's entire banking system systemically failed in October 2008 , leading to a severe depression , substantial political unrest , the Icesave dispute , and the institution of capital controls . Some bankers were jailed . Since then , the economy has made a significant recovery , in large part due to a surge in tourism .   Icelandic culture is founded upon the nation 's Scandinavian heritage . Most Icelanders are descendants of Germanic and Gaelic settlers . Icelandic , a North Germanic language , is descended from Old Norse and is closely related to Faroese and West Norwegian dialects . The country 's cultural heritage includes traditional Icelandic cuisine , Icelandic literature and medieval sagas . Iceland has the smallest population of any NATO member and is the only one with no standing army , its lightly armed coast guard being in charge of defence ."}

It is the world 's second-largest religion and the fastest-growing major religion in the world , with over 1.8 billion followers or 24.1 % of the global population , known as Muslims . Islam teaches that God who is merciful , all-powerful , and unique has guided mankind through prophets , revealed scriptures and natural signs . The primary scriptures of Islam are the Quran , viewed by Muslims as the verbatim word of God , and the teachings and normative example ( called the sunnah , composed of accounts called hadith ) of Muhammad ( 570 -- 8 June 632 CE ) .   Muslims believe that Islam is the complete and universal version of a primordial faith that was revealed many times before through prophets including Adam , Abraham , Moses , and Jesus . As for the Quran , Muslims consider it to be the unaltered and final revelation of God . Like other Abrahamic religions , Islam also teaches a final judgment with the righteous rewarded paradise and unrighteous are punished in hell . Religious concepts and practices include the five pillars of Islam , which are obligatory acts of worship , and following Islamic law , which touches on virtually every aspect of life and society , from banking and welfare to women and the environment . The cities of Mecca , Medina and Jerusalem are home to the three holiest sites in Islam .   Islam originated in the early 7th century in Mecca , and by the 8th century the Islamic empire extended from Iberia in the west to the Indus River in the east . The Islamic Golden Age refers to the period traditionally dated from the 8th century to the 13th century when much of the historically Islamic world was experiencing a scientific , economic and cultural flourishing . The expansion of the Muslim world involved various caliphates and empires , traders and conversion to Islam by missionary activities .   Most Muslims are of one of two denominations : Sunni ( 75 -- 90 % ) or Shia ( 10 -- 20 % ) . About 13 % of Muslims live in Indonesia , the largest Muslim-majority country , 31 % in South Asia , the largest population of Muslims in the world , 23 % in the Middle East-North Africa , where it is the dominant religion , and 15 % in Sub-Saharan Africa . Sizable Muslim communities are also found in the Americas , Caucasus , China , Europe , Mainland Southeast Asia , Philippines and Russia .

Situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans , it is the world 's largest island country , with more than seventeen thousand islands . At 1,904,569 km2 , Indonesia is the world 's 14th-largest country in terms of land area and world 's 7th-largest country in terms of combined sea and land area . It has an estimated population of over 260 million people and is the world 's fourth most populous country , the most populous Austronesian nation , as well as the most populous Muslim-majority country . The world 's most populous island , Java , contains more than half of the country 's population .   Indonesia 's republican form of government includes an elected legislature and president . Indonesia has 34 provinces , of which five have Special Administrative status . Its capital and country 's most populous city is Jakarta , which is also the most populous city in Southeast Asia and the second in Asia . The country shares land borders with Papua New Guinea , East Timor , and the eastern part of Malaysia . Other neighbouring countries include Singapore , Vietnam , the Philippines , Australia , Palau , and the Indian territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands . Despite its large population and densely populated regions , Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support the world 's second highest level of biodiversity . The country has abundant natural resources like oil and natural gas , tin , copper and gold . Agriculture mainly produces rice , palm oil , tea , coffee , cacao , medicinal plants , spices and rubber . Indonesia 's major trading partners are Japan , United States , China and the surrounding countries of Singapore , Malaysia and Australia .   The Indonesian archipelago has been an important region for trade since at least the 7th century , when Srivijaya and then later Majapahit traded with China and India . Local rulers gradually absorbed foreign cultural , religious and political models from the early centuries CE , and Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished . Indonesian history has been influenced by foreign powers drawn to its natural resources . Muslim traders and Sufi scholars brought the now-dominant Islam , while European powers brought Christianity and fought one another to monopolise trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of Discovery . Following three and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism starting from Amboina and Batavia , and eventually all of the archipelago including Timor and Western New Guinea , at times interrupted by Portuguese , French and British rule , Indonesia secured its independence after World War II .   Indonesia consists of hundreds of distinct native ethnic and linguistic groups , with the largest -- and politically dominant -- ethnic group being the Javanese . The population is unevenly spread throughout the islands within a variety of habitats and levels of development , ranging from the megalopolis of Jakarta to uncontacted tribes in the east . A shared identity has developed , defined by a national language , ethnic diversity , religious pluralism within a Muslim-majority population , and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it . Indonesia 's national motto , `` Bhinneka Tunggal Ika '' ( `` Unity in Diversity '' literally , `` many , yet one '' ) , articulates the diversity that shapes the country . Indonesia 's economy is the world 's 16th largest by nominal GDP and the 8th largest by GDP at PPP , the largest in Southeast Asia , and is considered an emerging market and newly industrialised country . Indonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950 . Indonesia was an organizer of the Bandung Conference and was the founder of Non-Aligned Movement ; and also the founding member of Association of Southeast Asian Nations , Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation , East Asia Summit , and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation . Indonesia is a member of the G20 major economies and World Trade Organization ."}

{"_id":"John_Deighton","title":"John Deighton","text":"John Deighton ( November 1830 -- May 23 , 1875 ) , generally known as `` Gassy Jack '' , was a Canadian bar owner who was born in Hull , England . The Gastown neighbourhood of Vancouver , British Columbia is named after him .   Growing up in Hull , a major seaport , Deighton and his brothers Tom and Richard learned to sail . Tom and Richard apprenticed on British ships , but Jack did not receive that opportunity . However , this meant he could switch to sailing on U.S. ships . When the California Gold Rush hit , ships were in demand to transport cargo and people from New York to San Francisco . In 1850 , this voyage around Cape Horn took 140 -- 160 days . Deighton signed up to work a new clipper Invincible that could sail 400 miles a day and made the trip in only 115 days . The next journey was to Hong Kong . Deighton was 21 years old and Third Officer . Next , Deighton visited family at home in England and then returned to the U.S. , never returning to England again .   Next , Deighton worked a gold claim in California , along with many others , until February 1858 when there was news of gold further north in a British territory known as New Caledonia . The Fraser Canyon Gold Rush had begun and Deighton sailed north along with thousands of others . The harsh winter took its toll on the prospectors but Deighton stayed for 5 years . He found no gold , though others did . New Caledonia was now the Colony of British Columbia . Traffic on the Fraser River was increasing as more miners arrived , but so far only American steamers were able to travel beyond Langley . Local boats were built to meet this need and Deighton piloted steamships and sternwheelers on the Fraser River for several years .   By 1864 , Deighton was forced to pursue other lines of work as he developed health problems ( swelling of the legs and feet ) .   Between 1862 and 1867 , he ran a bar called the Globe Saloon in New Westminster , British Columbia . It was quite prosperous due to the Cariboo Gold Rush . But in 1867 when Deighton went out of town to visit the hot mineral springs near Harrison Lake , he entrusted the bar to an old shipmate , an American . On July 4 the celebrations got out of hand and Deighton returned to find his business ruined .   In 1867 , Deighton opened a bar on the south side of Burrard Inlet at the behest of his old friend , Captain Edward Stamp , the owner of the Hastings Mill . He later named it the Globe Saloon in memory of his previous bar in New Westminster . He came to the area with little more than $ 6 to his name , a few simple pieces of furniture , his native wife ( whose name has been lost to the years ) , and a yellow dog . The bar was built by idle sawmill workers in exchange for all the whiskey they could drink in one sitting ( the nearest drinking hole was 25 miles away ) . His patrons were mainly sailors and workers from the nearby sawmill . When business dwindled there , Deighton tried to acquire 20 waterfront acres near Moody 's Mill and build a new saloon there . The local natives protested and the Governor agreed - Deighton went back to his previous bar , the Globe Saloon . This bar was demolished when the townsite of Granville was established . Deighton bought a nearby lot for $ 135 at the south-west corner of Carrall and Water Streets , where he built Deighton House .   Deighton 's native wife died . Before she died she arranged for Deighton to marry her 12-year-old niece Quahail-ya , also known as Madeline or Matrine . In 1871 she gave birth to Richard Mason Deighton . Jack 's brother Tom Deighton and his wife took over the business in 1873 and Jack returned to working the steamship that plied the Fraser River , this time as a Captain of the steamer Onward . However , after a family quarrel a few months later , Jack resumed management of the saloon and operated it until he became ill and died at the age of 44 on May 23 , 1875 . He is interred at the Fraser Cemetery in New Westminster , British Columbia . The location of the monument is ( WGS84 ) .   Deighton was known as Gassy Jack because of his talkative nature and his penchant for storytelling . The name stuck and the area around his bar is now known as Gastown .   He was succeeded by his son with Quahail-ya , Richard , who was derisively nicknamed the `` Earl of Granville '' . Richard died before Jack 's meager estate ( about $ 300 ) was probated . Quahail-ya returned to the North Shore and married `` Big William '' . She outlived him too , and died August 10 , 1948 , aged 90 .   The Deighton House was later burned in the Great Vancouver Fire of June 1886 .   In honour of Jack Deighton , the Gassy Jack statue stands in Maple Tree Square , in Gastown ."}
{"_id":"James_VI_and_I","title":"James VI and I","text":"James VI and I ( 19 June 1566 -- 27 March 1625 ) was King of Scotland as James VI from 24 July 1567 and King of England and Ireland as James I from the union of the Scottish and English crowns on 24 March 1603 until his death . The kingdoms of Scotland and England were individual sovereign states , with their own parliaments , judiciary , and laws , though both were ruled by James in personal union .   James was the son of Mary , Queen of Scots , and a great-great-grandson of Henry VII , King of England and Lord of Ireland , positioning him to eventually accede to all three thrones . James succeeded to the Scottish throne at the age of thirteen months , after his mother Mary was compelled to abdicate in his favour . Four different regents governed during his minority , which ended officially in 1578 , though he did not gain full control of his government until 1583 . In 1603 , he succeeded the last Tudor monarch of England and Ireland , Elizabeth I , who died without issue . He continued to reign in all three kingdoms for 22 years , a period known after him as the Jacobean era , until his death in 1625 at the age of 58 . After the Union of the Crowns , he based himself in England ( the largest of the three realms ) from 1603 , only returning to Scotland once in 1617 , and styled himself `` King of Great Britain and Ireland '' . He was a major advocate of a single parliament for England and Scotland . In his reign , the Plantation of Ulster and British colonization of the Americas began .   At 57 years and 246 days , James 's reign in Scotland was longer than those of any of his predecessors . He achieved most of his aims in Scotland but faced great difficulties in England , including the Gunpowder Plot in 1605 and repeated conflicts with the English Parliament . Under James , the `` Golden Age '' of Elizabethan literature and drama continued , with writers such as William Shakespeare , John Donne , Ben Jonson , and Sir Francis Bacon contributing to a flourishing literary culture . James himself was a talented scholar , the author of works such as Daemonologie ( 1597 ) , The True Law of Free Monarchies ( 1598 ) , and Basilikon Doron ( 1599 ) . He sponsored the translation of the Bible that would later be named after him : the Authorised King James Version . Sir Anthony Weldon claimed that James had been termed `` the wisest fool in Christendom '' , an epithet associated with his character ever since . Since the latter half of the 20th century , historians have tended to revise James 's reputation and treat him as a serious and thoughtful monarch ."}

{"_id":"Leukemia","title":"Leukemia","text":"Leukemia , also spelled leukaemia , is a group of cancers that usually begin in the bone marrow and result in high numbers of abnormal white blood cells . These white blood cells are not fully developed and are called blasts or leukemia cells . Symptoms may include bleeding and bruising problems , feeling tired , fever , and an increased risk of infections . These symptoms occur due to a lack of normal blood cells . Diagnosis is typically made by blood tests or bone marrow biopsy .   The exact cause of leukemia is unknown . Different kinds of leukemia are believed to have different causes . Both inherited and environmental ( non-inherited ) factors are believed to be involved . Risk factors include smoking , ionizing radiation , some chemicals ( such as benzene ) , prior chemotherapy , and Down syndrome . People with a family history of leukemia are also at higher risk . There are four main types of leukemia -- acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) , acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) and chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) -- as well as a number of less common types . Leukemias and lymphomas both belong to a broader group of tumors that affect the blood , bone marrow , and lymphoid system , known as tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues .   Treatment may involve some combination of chemotherapy , radiation therapy , targeted therapy , and bone marrow transplant , in addition to supportive care and palliative care as needed . Certain types of leukemia may be managed with watchful waiting . The success of treatment depends on the type of leukemia and the age of the person . Outcomes have improved in the developed world . The average five-year survival rate is 57 % in the United States . In children under 15 , the five-year survival rate is greater than 60 to 85 % , depending on the type of leukemia . In children with acute leukemia who are cancer-free after five years , the cancer is unlikely to return .   In 2015 , leukemia was present in 2.3 million people and caused 353,500 deaths . In 2012 it newly developed in 352,000 people . It is the most common type of cancer in children , with three quarters of leukemia cases in children being the acute lymphoblastic type . However , about 90 % of all leukemias are diagnosed in adults , with AML and CLL being most common in adults . It occurs more commonly in the developed world ."}

{"_id":"Martin_Van_Buren","title":"Martin Van Buren","text":"Martin Van Buren ( Maarten van Buren ; December 5 , 1782 -- July 24 , 1862 ) was an American politician who served as the eighth President of the United States ( 1837 -- 41 ) . A member of the Democratic Party , he served in a number of other senior roles , including eighth Vice President ( 1833 -- 37 ) and tenth Secretary of State ( 1829 -- 31 ) , both under Andrew Jackson . Van Buren won the presidency by promising to continue Jackson 's policies . Shortly after taking office , the Panic of 1837 struck the nation , and his inability to deal effectively with the economic crisis , combined with the growing political strength of the opposition Whig Party , led to his defeat in the 1840 presidential election . During his half-century of public service , he built , perfected , and defended a new system of political parties at first the state and then the federal level . In New York he reorganized the Democratic-Republican Party and established the Albany Regency to keep it in power . He then moved on Washington where he did more than anyone to construct the modern Democratic Party which dominated American politics down to the American Civil War .   A delegate to a political convention at age 18 , he quickly moved from local to state politics , gaining fame both as a political organizer and an accomplished lawyer . Elected to the Senate by the New York State Legislature in 1821 , Van Buren supported William H. Crawford for president in the 1824 election , but by 1828 had come to support Jackson . Van Buren was a major supporter and organizer for Jackson in the 1828 election , and ran for Governor of New York in the hope of using his personal popularity to boost Jackson 's campaign . Jackson and Van Buren were elected , and after serving as governor for two months , Van Buren resigned to become Jackson 's Secretary of State . During Jackson 's eight years as president , Van Buren was a key advisor , and built the organizational structure for the coalescing Democratic Party , particularly in New York . In 1831 , following his resignation as Secretary of State , which aided Jackson in resolving the Petticoat affair , Jackson gave Van Buren a recess appointment as American minister to Britain . Van Buren 's nomination was rejected by the Senate , cutting short his service in London , but he was elected vice president in the 1832 election .   Van Buren faced little opposition for the presidential nomination at the 1835 Democratic National Convention , and he defeated several Whig opponents in the 1836 presidential election . He was the first president to be born a United States citizen . Of Dutch ancestry , he is the only president who spoke English as a second language , and was the first not to have a university degree or a military commission . As president , Van Buren was blamed for the depression of 1837 ; hostile newspapers called him `` Martin Van Ruin '' . He attempted to cure the economic problems by keeping control of federal funds in an independent treasury , rather than in state banks , but Congress would not approve of this until 1840 . In foreign affairs , he denied the application of Texas for admission to the Union , unwilling to upset the balance of free and slave states in the Missouri Compromise , and hoping to avoid war with Mexico over Texas annexation . Additionally , relations with Britain and its colonies in Canada proved to be strained from the bloodless Aroostook War and the Caroline Affair . In the 1840 election , Van Buren was voted out of office , losing to Whig candidate William Henry Harrison .   Van Buren was the leading candidate for the Democratic nomination in 1844 , but lost to James K. Polk , who went on to win the election . In the 1848 election Van Buren ran unsuccessfully as the candidate of the anti-slavery Free Soil Party . He returned to the Democratic fold to endorse Franklin Pierce ( 1852 ) , James Buchanan ( 1856 ) , and Stephen A. Douglas ( 1860 ) for the presidency . However , his increasingly abolitionist views and support for the Union led him to support Abraham Lincoln 's policies after the start of the American Civil War . Van Buren 's health began to fail in 1861 , and he died in July 1862 at age 79 ."}

{"_id":"Murder","title":"Murder","text":"A murder is the unlawful killing of another human without justification or valid excuse , especially the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought . This state of mind may , depending upon the jurisdiction , distinguish murder from other forms of unlawful homicide , such as manslaughter . Manslaughter is a killing committed in the absence of malice , brought about by reasonable provocation , or diminished capacity . Involuntary manslaughter , where it is recognized , is a killing that lacks all but the most attenuated guilty intent ( mens rea ) , recklessness .   Most societies consider murder to be a very serious crime , and thus believe that the person charged should receive harsh punishments for the purposes of retribution , deterrence , rehabilitation , or incapacitation . In most countries , a person convicted of murder generally faces a long-term prison sentence , possibly a life sentence where permitted .   In many common law jurisdictions , a person convicted of murder will receive a mandatory life sentence . In jurisdictions where capital punishment exists , the death penalty may be imposed for such an act ; however , this practice is now less common ."}

{"_id":"Mount_Rushmore","title":"Mount Rushmore","text":"Mount Rushmore National Memorial is a sculpture carved into the granite face of Mount Rushmore , a batholith in the Black Hills in Keystone , South Dakota , United States . Sculptor Gutzon Borglum created the sculpture 's design and oversaw the project 's execution from 1927-1941 with the help of his son , Lincoln Borglum . Mount Rushmore features 60 ft sculptures of the heads of four United States presidents : George Washington ( 1732 -- 1799 ) , Thomas Jefferson ( 1743 -- 1826 ) , Theodore Roosevelt ( 1858 -- 1919 ) , and Abraham Lincoln ( 1809 -- 1865 ) . The memorial park covers 1278.45 acre and is 5725 ft above sea level .   South Dakota historian Doane Robinson is credited with conceiving the idea of carving the likenesses of famous people into the Black Hills region of South Dakota in order to promote tourism in the region . Robinson 's initial idea was to sculpt the Needles ; however , Gutzon Borglum rejected the Needles because of the poor quality of the granite and strong opposition from Native American groups . They settled on Mount Rushmore , which also has the advantage of facing southeast for maximum sun exposure . Robinson wanted it to feature American West heroes like Lewis and Clark , Red Cloud , and Buffalo Bill Cody , but Borglum decided the sculpture should have broader appeal and chose the four presidents .   After securing federal funding through the enthusiastic sponsorship of `` Mount Rushmore 's great political patron '' U.S. Senator Peter Norbeck , construction on the memorial began in 1927 , and the presidents ' faces were completed between 1934 and 1939 . Upon Gutzon Borglum 's death in March 1941 , his son Lincoln Borglum took over as leader of the construction project . Each president was originally to be depicted from head to waist . Lack of funding forced construction to end in late October 1941 .   Mount Rushmore has become an iconic symbol of the United States , and it has appeared in works of fiction , as well as being discussed or depicted in other popular works . It attracts over two million visitors annually ."}

It was the flagship product of the Netscape Communications Corp and was the dominant web browser in terms of usage share in the 1990s , but by 2002 its usage had almost disappeared . This was primarily due to the increased usage of Microsoft 's Internet Explorer web browser software , and partly because the Netscape Corporation ( later purchased by AOL ) did not sustain Netscape Navigator 's technical innovation after the late 1990s .   The business demise of Netscape was a central premise of Microsoft 's antitrust trial , wherein the Court ruled that Microsoft Corporation 's bundling of Internet Explorer with the Windows operating system was a monopolistic and illegal business practice . The decision came too late for Netscape , however , as Internet Explorer had by then become the dominant web browser in Windows .

{"_id":"Neuromodulation","title":"Neuromodulation","text":"Neuromodulation is the physiological process by which a given neuron uses one or more chemicals to regulate diverse populations of neurons . This is in contrast to classical synaptic transmission , in which one presynaptic neuron directly influences a single postsynaptic partner . Neuromodulators secreted by a small group of neurons diffuse through large areas of the nervous system , affecting multiple neurons . Major neuromodulators in the central nervous system include dopamine , serotonin , acetylcholine , histamine , and norepinephrine .   Neuromodulation can be conceptualized as a neurotransmitter that is not reabsorbed by the pre-synaptic neuron or broken down into a metabolite . Such neuromodulators end up spending a significant amount of time in the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) , influencing ( or `` modulating '' ) the activity of several other neurons in the brain . For this reason , some neurotransmitters are also considered to be neuromodulators , such as serotonin and acetylcholine .   Neuromodulation is often contrasted with classical fast synaptic transmission . In both cases the transmitter acts on local postsynaptic receptors , but in neuromodulation , the receptors are typically G-protein coupled receptors while in classical chemical neurotransmission , they are ligand-gated ion channels . Neurotransmission that involves metabotropic receptors ( like G-protein linked receptors ) often also involves voltage-gated ion channels , and is relatively slow . Conversely , neurotransmission that involves exclusively ligand-gated ion channels is much faster .  A related distinction is also sometimes drawn between modulator and driver synaptic inputs to a neuron , but here the emphasis is on modulating ongoing neuronal spiking versus causing that spiking ."}

Sometimes described as `` the father of modern linguistics '' , Chomsky is also a major figure in analytic philosophy and one of the founders of the field of cognitive science . He is Institute Professor Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) , where he has worked since 1955 , and is the author of over 100 books on topics such as linguistics , war , politics , and mass media . Ideologically , he aligns with anarcho-syndicalism and libertarian socialism .   Born to middle-class Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants in Philadelphia , Chomsky developed an early interest in anarchism from alternative bookstores in New York City . At the age of sixteen he began studies at the University of Pennsylvania , taking courses in linguistics , mathematics , and philosophy . From 1951 to 1955 he was appointed to Harvard University 's Society of Fellows , where he developed the theory of transformational grammar for which he was awarded his doctorate in 1955 . That year he began teaching at MIT , in 1957 emerging as a significant figure in the field of linguistics for his landmark work Syntactic Structures , which remodeled the scientific study of language , while from 1958 to 1959 he was a National Science Foundation fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study . He is credited as the creator or co-creator of the universal grammar theory , the generative grammar theory , the Chomsky hierarchy , and the minimalist program . Chomsky also played a pivotal role in the decline of behaviorism , being particularly critical of the work of B. F. Skinner .   An outspoken opponent of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War , which he saw as an act of American imperialism , in 1967 Chomsky attracted widespread public attention for his anti-war essay `` The Responsibility of Intellectuals '' . Associated with the New Left , he was arrested multiple times for his activism and placed on President Richard Nixon 's Enemies List . While expanding his work in linguistics over subsequent decades , he also became involved in the Linguistics Wars . In collaboration with Edward S. Herman , Chomsky later co-wrote an analysis articulating the propaganda model of media criticism , and worked to expose the Indonesian occupation of East Timor . However , his defense of unconditional freedom of speech -- including for Holocaust deniers -- generated significant controversy in the Faurisson affair of the early 1980s . Following his retirement from active teaching , he has continued his vocal political activism , including opposing the War on Terror and supporting the Occupy movement .   One of the most cited scholars in history , Chomsky has influenced a broad array of academic fields . He is widely recognized as a paradigm shifter who helped spark a major revolution in the human sciences , contributing to the development of a new cognitivistic framework for the study of language and the mind . In addition to his continued scholarly research , he remains a leading critic of U.S. foreign policy , neoliberalism and contemporary state capitalism , the Israeli -- Palestinian conflict , and mainstream news media . His ideas have proved highly significant within the anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist movements , but have also drawn criticism , with some accusing Chomsky of anti-Americanism ."}

{"_id":"Norovirus","title":"Norovirus","text":"Norovirus , sometimes referred to as the winter vomiting bug in the UK and Ireland , is the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis in humans . It affects people of all ages . The virus is transmitted by fecally contaminated food or water , by person-to-person contact , and via aerosolization of vomited virus and subsequent contamination of surfaces . Annually , norovirus is associated with 906,000 outpatient visits in industrialized countries , with 64,200 inpatient hospitalizations . In developing countries , it is associated with 1.1 million hospitalizations , with an estimated 218,000 deaths .   Norovirus infection is characterized by nausea , vomiting , watery diarrhea , abdominal pain , and in some cases , loss of taste . A person usually develops symptoms of gastroenteritis 12 to 48 hours after being exposed to norovirus . General lethargy , weakness , muscle aches , headaches , and low-grade fevers may occur . The disease is usually self-limiting , and severe illness is rare . Although having norovirus can be unpleasant , it is not usually dangerous and most who contract it make a full recovery within two to three days . On surfaces , norovirus is rapidly inactivated by either sufficient heating or by chlorine-based disinfectants and polyquaternary amines , but the virus is less susceptible to alcohols and detergents .   After infection , immunity to the same strain of the virus -- the genotype -- protects against reinfection for between 4.1 ( 95 % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- 3.2 -- 5.1 ) to 8.7 ( 95 % CI 6.8 -- 11.3 ) years . This immunity does not fully protect against infection with the other diverse genotypes of the virus .   Outbreaks of norovirus infection often occur in closed or semiclosed communities , such as long-term care facilities , overnight camps , hospitals , schools , prisons , clubs , dormitories , and cruise ships , where the infection spreads very rapidly either by person-to-person transmission or through contaminated food . Many norovirus outbreaks have been traced to food that was handled by one infected person .   The genus name Norovirus is derived from Norwalk virus , the only species of the genus . The species causes approximately 90 % of epidemic nonbacterial outbreaks of gastroenteritis around the world , and may be responsible for 50 % of all foodborne outbreaks of gastroenteritis in the United States ."}

{"_id":"North_Vietnam","title":"North Vietnam","text":"North Vietnam , officially the Democratic Republic of Vietnam ( DRV ) , was a state in Southeast Asia which existed from 1945 to 1976 . Vietnamese revolutionary leader H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh declared independence from France on 2 September 1945 and announced the creation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam . France reasserted its colonial dominance and a war ensued between France and the Viet Minh , led by Ho . The Viet Minh ( `` League for the Independence of Vietnam '' ) was a coalition of nationalist groups , mostly led by communists . In February 1951 , the communists announced the creation of the Lao \u0110\u1ed9ng Party ( Labor Party ) , gradually marginalizing non-communists in the Vi\u1ec7t Minh .   Between 1946 and 1954 , the Vi\u1ec7t Minh captured and controlled most of the rural areas of Vietnam . In 1954 , after the French were defeated , the negotiation of the Geneva Accords ended the war between France and the Vi\u1ec7t Minh and granted Vietnam independence . The Geneva Accords divided the country provisionally into northern and southern zones , and stipulated general elections in July 1956 `` to bring about the unification of Viet-Nam '' . The northern zone was commonly called North Vietnam , and the southern zone was commonly called South Vietnam .   Supervision of the implementation of the Geneva Accords was the responsibility of an international commission consisting of India , Canada and Poland . The United States did not sign the Geneva Accords but instead stated that the U.S. `` shall continue to seek to achieve unity through free elections supervised by the United Nations to insure that they are conducted fairly . '' In July 1955 , the prime minister of the Republic of Vietnam , Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m , announced that the Republic of Vietnam would not participate in elections to unify the country . He said that South Vietnam had not signed the Geneva accords and was not bound by it .   With the failure to reunify Vietnam by elections , the Democratic Republic of Vietnam attempted to unify the country by force in the Vietnam War ( 1955 -- 75 ) . North Vietnam and the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng insurgents supported by their communist allies , including the Soviet Union and China , fought against the military of South Vietnam , the U.S. and other anti-communist military forces , including South Korea , Australia , Thailand and smaller players . North Vietnam also supported indigenous communist rebels in Cambodia and Laos against their respective U.S.-backed governments . The war ended when North Vietnamese forces and the Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng defeated the Republic of Vietnam and in 1976 united the two parts of the country into the Socialist Republic of Vietnam ."}

{"_id":"Pakistan_Movement","title":"Pakistan Movement","text":"The Pakistan Movement or Tehrik-e-Pakistan ( -LSB- -- ) was a religious political movement in the 1940s that aimed for and succeeded in the creation of Pakistan from the Muslim-majority areas of British Indian Empire .   The movement progressed within India alongside the Indian independence movement , but the Pakistan Movement sought to establish a new nation-state that protected the religious identity and political interests of Muslims in South Asia . The first organised political movements were in Aligarh where another literary movement was led by Sir Syed Ahmad Khan that built the genesis of the Pakistan movement . An educational convention held in 1906 with joint efforts of Syed Ahmad Khan and Vikar-ul-Haq , the Muslim reformers took the movement to the political stage in the form of establishing the mainstream and then newly formed All-India Muslim League ( AIML ) , with prominent moderate leaders seeking to protect the basic rights of Muslims in the British Raj . During the initial stages of the movement , it adopted the vision of philosopher Iqbal after addressing at the convention of the AIML 's annual session . Muhammad Ali Jinnah 's constitutional struggle further helped gaining public support for the movement in the four provinces . Urdu poets such as Iqbal and Faiz used literature , poetry and speech as a powerful tool for political awareness . Feminists such as Sheila Pant and Fatima Jinnah championed the emancipation of Pakistan 's women and their participation in national politics .   The Pakistan Movement was led by a large and diversified group of people whose struggle ultimately resulted in the British Empire announcing the Indian Independence Act 1947 , which created the independent dominions of India and Pakistan . The Pakistan Movement was the result of a series of social , political , and intellectual transformations in Pakistani society , government , and ways of thinking . Efforts and struggles of the Founding Fathers resulted in the creation of the democratic and independent government . In the following years , another nationally -- minded subset went on to established a strong government , followed by the military intervention in 1958 . Grievousness and unbalanced economic distribution caused an upheaval which led East Pakistan to declare independence as the People 's Republic of Bangladesh in 1971 . After a strong concessions and consents reached in 1973 , the new Constitution established a relatively strong government , institutions , national courts , a legislature that represented both states in the Senate and population in the National Assembly . Pakistan 's phase shift to republicanism , and the gradually increasing democracy , caused an upheaval of traditional social hierarchy and gave birth to the ethic that has formed a core of political values in Pakistan ."}

Overwatch assigns players into two teams of six , with each player selecting one of 24 pre-defined characters , called heroes , each with unique movement , attributes , and abilities , whose roles are divided into four categories : Offense , Defense , Tank , and Support . Players on a team work together to secure and defend control points on a map or escort a payload across the map in a limited amount of time . Players gain cosmetic rewards that do not affect gameplay , such as character skins and victory poses , as they play the game . The game was initially launched with casual play , with a competitive ranked mode , various ` arcade ' game modes , and a player-customizable server browser subsequently included following its release . Additionally , Blizzard has developed and added new characters , maps , and game modes post-release , while stating that all Overwatch updates will remain free , with the only additional cost to players being microtransactions to earn additional cosmetic rewards .   Overwatch is Blizzard 's fourth major franchise and came about following the 2014 cancellation of the ambitious massively multiplayer online role-playing game Titan . A portion of the Titan team came up with the concept of Overwatch , based on the success of team-based first-person shooters like Team Fortress 2 and the growing popularity of multiplayer online battle arenas , creating a hero-based shooter that emphasized teamwork . Some elements of Overwatch borrow assets and concepts from the canceled Titan project . After establishing the narrative of an optimistic near-future Earth setting after a global crisis , the developers aimed to create a diverse cast of heroes that spanned genders and ethnicities as part of this setting . Significant time was spent adjusting the balance of the characters , making sure that new players would still be able to have fun while skilled players would present each other with a challenge .   Overwatch was unveiled at BlizzCon 2014 in a fully playable state and was in a closed beta from late 2015 through early 2016 . An open beta in May 2016 drew in more than 9.7 million players .

It is bordered in the north by Ecuador and Colombia , in the east by Brazil , in the southeast by Bolivia , in the south by Chile , and in the west by the Pacific Ocean . Peru is an extremely biodiverse country with habitats ranging from the arid plains of the Pacific coastal region in the west to the peaks of the Andes mountains vertically extending from the north to the southeast of the country to the tropical Amazon Basin rainforest in the east with the Amazon river .   Peruvian territory was home to ancient cultures spanning from the Norte Chico civilization in Caral ( one of the oldest in the world with settlements as old as 3200 BC ) to the Inca Empire , the largest state in Pre-Columbian America . The Spanish Empire conquered the region in the 16th century and established a Viceroyalty with its capital in Lima , which included most of its South American colonies . Ideas of political autonomy later spread throughout Spanish America and Peru gained its independence , which was formally proclaimed in 1821 after the occupation by military campaigns of Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn and Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar and only after the battle of Ayacucho , three years after proclamation , Peru ensured its independence . After achieving independence , the country remained in recession and kept a low military profile until an economic rise based on the extraction of raw and maritime materials struck the country , which ended shortly before the war of the Pacific . Subsequently , the country has undergone changes in government from oligarchic to democratic systems . Peru has gone through periods of political unrest and internal conflict as well as periods of stability and economic upswing .   Peru is a representative democratic republic divided into 25 regions . It is a developing country with a high Human Development Index score and a poverty level around 25.8 percent . Its main economic activities include mining , manufacturing , agriculture and fishing .   The Peruvian population , estimated at 31.2 million in 2015 , is multiethnic , including Amerindians , Europeans , Africans and Asians . The main spoken language is Spanish , although a significant number of Peruvians speak Quechua or other native languages .

Before forming Queen , Brian May and Roger Taylor had played together in a band named Smile . Freddie Mercury ( then known by his birth name of Farrokh `` Freddie '' Bulsara ) was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques . Mercury joined the band in 1970 , suggested `` Queen '' as a new band name , and adopted his familiar stage name . John Deacon was recruited before the band recorded their eponymous debut album in 1973 . Queen first charted in the UK with their second album , Queen II , in 1974 , but it was the release of Sheer Heart Attack later that year and A Night at the Opera in 1975 which brought them international success . The latter featured `` Bohemian Rhapsody '' , which stayed at number one in the UK for nine weeks and popularised the music video .   The band 's 1977 album News of the World contained `` We Will Rock You '' and `` We Are the Champions '' , which have become anthems at sporting events . By the early 1980s , Queen were one of the biggest stadium rock bands in the world . Released in 1980 , `` Another One Bites the Dust '' is their best selling single , while their 1981 compilation album Greatest Hits is the best-selling album in the UK and is certified eight times platinum in the US . Their performance at the 1985 Live Aid concert has been ranked among the greatest in rock history by various music publications , and the best in a 2005 industry poll . In 1991 , Mercury died of bronchopneumonia , a complication of AIDS , and Deacon retired in 1997 . Since then , May and Taylor have performed under the name of Queen with Paul Rodgers and Adam Lambert as vocalists on several tours .   The band have released a total of 18 number-one albums , 18 number-one singles , and 10 number-one DVDs . Estimates of their record sales generally range from 150 million to 300 million records , making them one of the world 's best-selling music artists . Queen received the Outstanding Contribution to British Music Award from the British Phonographic Industry in 1990 . They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001 ."}

{"_id":"Pulmonary_embolism","title":"Pulmonary embolism","text":"Pulmonary embolism ( PE ) is a blockage of an artery in the lungs by a substance that has traveled from elsewhere in the body through the bloodstream ( embolism ) . Symptoms of a PE may include shortness of breath , chest pain particularly upon breathing in , and coughing up blood . Symptoms of a blood clot in the leg may also be present such as a red , warm , swollen , and painful leg . Signs of a PE include low blood oxygen levels , rapid breathing , rapid heart rate , and sometimes a mild fever . Severe cases can lead to passing out , abnormally low blood pressure , and sudden death .   PE usually results from a blood clot in the leg that travels to the lung . The risk of blood clots is increased by cancer , prolonged bed rest , smoking , stroke , certain genetic conditions , estrogen-based medication , pregnancy , obesity , and after some types of surgery . A small proportion of cases are due to the embolization of air , fat , or amniotic fluid . Diagnosis is based on signs and symptoms in combination with test results . If the risk is low a blood test known as a D-dimer will rule out the condition . Otherwise a CT pulmonary angiography , lung ventilation\/perfusion scan , or ultrasound of the legs may confirm the diagnosis . Together deep vein thrombosis and PE are known as venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) .   Efforts to prevent PE include beginning to move as soon as possible after surgery , lower leg exercises during periods of sitting , and the use of blood thinners after some types of surgery . Treatment is typically with blood thinners such as heparin or warfarin . Often these are recommended for six months or longer . Severe cases may require thrombolysis using medication such as tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) , or may require surgery such as a pulmonary thrombectomy . If blood thinners are not appropriate , a vena cava filter may be used .   Pulmonary emboli affect about 430,000 people each year in Europe . In the United States between 300,000 and 600,000 cases occur each year , which results in between 50,000 and 200,000 deaths . Rates are similar in males and females . They become more common as people get older ."}

{"_id":"Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers","title":"Red Hot Chili Peppers","text":"Red Hot Chili Peppers , also sometimes shortened to The Chili Peppers or abbreviated as RHCP , are an American alternative rock\/funk rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1983 . The group 's musical style primarily consists of rock with an emphasis on funk , as well as elements from other genres such as punk rock and psychedelic rock . When played live , their music incorporates elements of jam band due to the improvised nature of much of their performances . Currently , the band consists of founding members vocalist Anthony Kiedis and bassist Flea , longtime drummer Chad Smith , and former touring guitarist Josh Klinghoffer . Red Hot Chili Peppers are one of the best-selling bands of all time with over 80 million records sold worldwide , have been nominated for sixteen Grammy Awards , of which they have won six , and are the most successful band in alternative rock radio history , currently holding the records for most number-one singles ( 13 ) , most cumulative weeks at number one ( 85 ) and most top-ten songs ( 25 ) on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart . In 2012 , they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame .   The band 's original line-up , originally named Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem , featured guitarist Hillel Slovak and drummer Jack Irons , alongside Kiedis and Flea . Because of commitments to other bands , Slovak and Irons did not play on the band 's self-titled debut album ( 1984 ) . Slovak performed on the second and third albums , Freaky Styley ( 1985 ) and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan ( 1987 ) , but he died from a heroin overdose in 1988 . As a result of his friend 's death , Irons chose to leave the group . After short-lived replacements at guitar and drums , John Frusciante and Chad Smith joined in 1988 . The line-up of Flea , Kiedis , Frusciante , and Smith was the longest-lasting and recorded five studio albums beginning with Mother 's Milk ( 1989 ) . In 1990 , the group signed with Warner Bros. . Records and recorded the album Blood Sugar Sex Magik ( 1991 ) under producer Rick Rubin . This album became the band 's first commercial success , but Frusciante grew uncomfortable with it and left abruptly in 1992 in the middle of the Blood Sugar Sex Magik Tour .   After two temporary guitarists , Dave Navarro joined the group in 1993 and played on their subsequent album , One Hot Minute ( 1995 ) . Although commercially successful , the album failed to match the critical or popular acclaim of Blood Sugar Sex Magik , selling less than half as much as its predecessor . Navarro was fired from the band in 1998 . Frusciante , fresh out of drug rehabilitation , rejoined the band that same year at Flea 's request . The reunited quartet returned to the studio to record Californication ( 1999 ) , which became the band 's biggest commercial success with 16 million copies worldwide . That album was followed three years later by By the Way ( 2002 ) , and then four years later by the double album Stadium Arcadium ( 2006 ) , their first number-one album in America . After a world tour , the group went on an extended hiatus . Frusciante announced he was amicably leaving the band in 2009 to focus on his solo career . Klinghoffer , who had worked both as a sideman for the band on their Stadium Arcadium tour and on Frusciante 's solo projects , replaced him .

Republika Makedonija ) , is a country in the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe . It is one of the successor states of the former Yugoslavia , from which it declared independence in 1991 . It became a member of the United Nations in 1993 , but , as a result of an ongoing dispute with Greece over the use of the name `` Macedonia '' , was admitted under the provisional description the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ( sometimes abbreviated as FYROM and FYR Macedonia ) , a term that is also used by international organizations such as the European Union , the Council of Europe and NATO .   A landlocked country , the Republic of Macedonia has borders with Kosovo to the northwest , Serbia to the north , Bulgaria to the east , Greece to the south , and Albania to the west . It constitutes approximately the northwestern third of the larger geographical region of Macedonia , which also comprises the neighbouring parts of northern Greece and smaller portions of southwestern Bulgaria and southeastern Albania . The country 's geography is defined primarily by mountains , valleys , and rivers . The capital and largest city , Skopje , is home to roughly a quarter of the nation 's 2.06 million inhabitants . The majority of the residents are ethnic Macedonians , a South Slavic people . Albanians form a significant minority at around 25 percent , followed by Turks , Romani , Serbs , and others .   Macedonia 's history dates back to antiquity , beginning with the kingdom of Paeonia , a Thracian polity . In the late sixth century BCE the area was incorporated into the Persian Achaemenid Empire , then annexed by the Kingdom of Macedonia in the fourth century BCE . The Romans conquered the region in the second century BCE and made it part of the much larger province of Macedonia . Macedonia remained part of the Byzantine ( Eastern Roman ) Empire , and was often raided and settled by Slavic peoples beginning in the sixth century CE . Following centuries of contention between the Bulgarian and Byzantine empires , it gradually came under Ottoman dominion from the 14th century . Between the late 19th and early 20th century , a distinct Macedonian identity emerged , although following the Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913 , the modern territory of Macedonia came under Serbian rule . In the aftermath of the First World War ( 1914 -- 1918 ) it became incorporated into the Serb-dominated Kingdom of Yugoslavia , which after the Second World War was re-established as a republic ( 1945 ) and which became the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1963 . Macedonia remained a constituent socialist republic within Yugoslavia until its peaceful secession in 1991 .   Macedonia is a member of the UN and of the Council of Europe . Since 2005 it has also been a candidate for joining the European Union and has applied for NATO membership . Although one of the poorest countries in Europe , Macedonia has made significant progress in developing an open , market based economy ."}

After the war , the confluence of returning servicemen , massive immigration , liberalizing attitudes , along with the rise of the `` hippie '' counterculture , the Sexual Revolution , the Peace Movement growing from opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War , and other factors led to the Summer of Love and the gay rights movement , cementing San Francisco as a center of liberal activism in the United States .

It is the largest island of a small , circular archipelago which bears the same name and is the remnant of a volcanic caldera . It forms the southernmost member of the Cyclades group of islands , with an area of approximately 73 km2 and a 2011 census population of 15,550 . The municipality of Santorini includes the inhabited islands of Santorini and Therasia and the uninhabited islands of Nea Kameni , Palaia Kameni , Aspronisi , and Christiana . The total land area is 90.623 km2 . Santorini is part of the Thira regional unit .   Santorini is essentially what remains after an enormous volcanic eruption that destroyed the earliest settlements on a formerly single island , and created the current geological caldera . A giant central , rectangular lagoon , which measures about 12 by , is surrounded by 300 m high , steep cliffs on three sides . The main island slopes downward to the Aegean Sea . On the fourth side , the lagoon is separated from the sea by another much smaller island called Therasia ; the lagoon is connected to the sea in two places , in the northwest and southwest . The depth of the caldera , at 400m , makes it impossible for any but the largest ships to anchor anywhere in the protected bay ; there is also a fisherman 's harbour at Vlychada , on the southwestern coast . The island 's principal port is Athinios . The capital , Fira , clings to the top of the cliff looking down on the lagoon . The volcanic rocks present from the prior eruptions feature olivine , and have a small presence of hornblende .   It is the most active volcanic centre in the South Aegean Volcanic Arc , though what remains today is chiefly a water-filled caldera . The volcanic arc is approximately 500 km long and 20 to wide . The region first became volcanically active around 3 -- 4 million years ago , though volcanism on Thera began around 2 million years ago with the extrusion of dacitic lavas from vents around the Akrotiri .   The island is the site of one of the largest volcanic eruptions in recorded history : the Minoan eruption ( sometimes called the Thera eruption ) , which occurred some 3,600 years ago at the height of the Minoan civilization . The eruption left a large caldera surrounded by volcanic ash deposits hundreds of metres deep and may have led indirectly to the collapse of the Minoan civilization on the island of Crete , 110 km to the south , through a gigantic tsunami . Another popular theory holds that the Thera eruption is the source of the legend of Atlantis ."}

The region has expanded to include the southern half of the San Francisco Peninsula in San Mateo County , and southern portions of the East Bay in Alameda County .   The word `` silicon '' originally referred to the large number of silicon chip innovators and manufacturers in the region , but the area is now the home to many of the world 's largest high-tech corporations , including the headquarters of 39 businesses in the Fortune 1000 , and thousands of startup companies . Silicon Valley also accounts for one-third of all of the venture capital investment in the United States , which has helped it to become a leading hub and startup ecosystem for high-tech innovation and scientific development . It was in the Valley that the silicon-based integrated circuit , the microprocessor , and the microcomputer , among other key technologies , were developed . As of 2013 , the region employed about a quarter of a million information technology workers .   As more high-tech companies were established across the Santa Clara Valley , and then north towards the Bay Area 's two other major cities , San Francisco and Oakland , the `` Silicon Valley '' name eventually came to refer to all high-tech businesses in the region . The term is now generally used as a synecdoche for the American high-technology economic sector . The name also became a global synonym for leading high-tech research and enterprises , and thus inspired similar named locations , as well as research parks and technology centers with a comparable structure all around the world ."}

The territory of Skopje has been inhabited since at least 4000 BC ; remains of Neolithic settlements have been found within the old Kale Fortress that overlooks the modern city centre . On the eve of the 1st century AD , the settlement was seized by the Romans and became a military camp . When the Roman Empire was divided into eastern and western halves in 395 AD , Scupi came under Byzantine rule from Constantinople . During much of the early medieval period , the town was contested between the Byzantines and the Bulgarian Empire , whose capital it was between 972 and 992 . From 1282 , the town was part of the Serbian Empire and acted as its capital city from 1346 to 1371 . In 1392 , the city was conquered by the Ottoman Turks who called the town \u00dcsk\u00fcp . The town stayed under Turkish control for over 500 years , serving as the capital of pashasanjak of \u00dcsk\u00fcb and later the Vilayet of Kosovo . At that time the city was famous for its oriental architecture . In 1912 , it was annexed by the Kingdom of Serbia during the Balkan Wars and after the First World War the city became part of the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes ( Kingdom of Yugoslavia ) . In the Second World War the city was conquered by the Bulgarian Army , which was part of the Axis powers . In 1944 , it became the capital city of Democratic Macedonia ( later Socialist Republic of Macedonia ) , which was a federal state , part of Democratic Federal Yugoslavia ( later Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ) . The city developed rapidly after World War II , but this trend was interrupted in 1963 when it was hit by a disastrous earthquake .

{"_id":"Stanford_prison_experiment","title":"Stanford prison experiment","text":"The Stanford prison experiment ( SPE ) was an attempt to investigate the psychological effects of perceived power , focusing on the struggle between prisoners and prison guards . It was conducted at Stanford University on August 14 -- 20 , 1971 , by a research group led by psychology professor Philip Zimbardo using college students . It was funded by the U.S. Office of Naval Research as an investigation into the causes of difficulties between guards and prisoners in the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps . The experiment is a topic covered in most introductory psychology textbooks .   Some participants developed their roles as the guards and enforced authoritarian measures and ultimately subjected some prisoners to psychological torture . Many of the prisoners passively accepted psychological abuse and , by the guards ' request , actively harassed other prisoners who tried to stop it . Zimbardo , in his role as the superintendent , allowed abuse to continue . Two of the prisoners left mid-experiment , and the whole exercise was abandoned after six days following the objections of graduate student Christina Maslach , whom Zimbardo was dating ( and later married ) . Certain portions of the experiment were filmed , and excerpts of footage are publicly available ."}

Ecology  Resting and feeding places of migratory birds are referred to as staging areas .   Entertainment  Places designated for setting up parades and other elaborate presentations .   Military  In military usage , a staging area is a place where troops or equipment in transit are assembled or processed .  The US Department of Defense uses these definitions :   Often and historically this military staging area has been termed a point d'appui , which is often on high ground and sometimes coincident with a significant prehistoric monument , as in the case of Catto Long Barrow in Aberdeenshire , Scotland . Unlike normal bases , the facilities of a staging area are temporary , mainly because for a certain time it will hold much more troops and materiel than would be reasonable in peacetime .   Militaries use staging areas to deploy military units , aircraft and warships and materiel ahead of an attack or invasion . In former times , this used to be generally the border area of one 's own country , but in recent wars ( Gulf War , Kosovo War , Iraq War ) it may also be the border area of another unrelated country granting access .

{"_id":"Stanley_Kubrick","title":"Stanley Kubrick","text":"Stanley Kubrick ( -LSB- \u02c8ku\u02d0br\u026ak -RSB- July 26 , 1928 -- March 7 , 1999 ) was an American film director , screenwriter , producer , cinematographer , editor , and photographer . He is frequently cited as one of the greatest and most influential directors in cinematic history . His films , which are mostly adaptations of novels or short stories , cover a wide range of genres , and are noted for their realism , dark humor , unique cinematography , extensive set designs , and evocative use of music .   Kubrick was born and raised in the Bronx , New York City , and attended William Howard Taft High School from 1941 to 1945 . Although he only received average grades , Kubrick displayed a keen interest in literature , photography , and film from a young age , and taught himself all aspects of film production and directing after graduating from high school . After working as a photographer for Look magazine in the late 1940s and early 1950s , he began making short films on a shoestring budget , and made his first major Hollywood film , The Killing , for United Artists in 1956 . This was followed by two collaborations with Kirk Douglas , the war picture Paths of Glory ( 1957 ) and the historical epic Spartacus ( 1960 ) . His reputation as a filmmaker in Hollywood grew , and he was approached by Marlon Brando to film what would become One-Eyed Jacks ( 1961 ) , though Brando eventually decided to direct it himself .   Creative differences arising from his work with Douglas and the film studios , a dislike of Hollywood , and a growing concern about crime in America prompted Kubrick to move to the United Kingdom in 1961 , where he spent most of the remainder of his life and career . His home at Childwickbury Manor in Hertfordshire , which he shared with his wife Christiane , became his workplace , where he did his writing , research , editing , and management of production details . This allowed him to have almost complete artistic control over his films , but with the rare advantage of having financial support from major Hollywood studios . His first British productions were two films with Peter Sellers , Lolita ( 1962 ) and Dr. Strangelove ( 1964 ) .   A demanding perfectionist , Kubrick assumed control over most aspects of the filmmaking process , from direction and writing to editing , and took painstaking care with researching his films and staging scenes , working in close coordination with his actors and other collaborators . He often asked for several dozen retakes of the same scene in a movie , which resulted in many conflicts with his casts . Despite the resulting notoriety among actors , many of Kubrick 's films broke new ground in cinematography . The scientific realism and innovative special effects of 2001 : A Space Odyssey ( 1968 ) were without precedent in the history of cinema , and the film earned him his only personal Oscar , for Best Visual Effects . Steven Spielberg has referred to the film as his generation 's `` big bang '' , and it is regarded as one of the greatest films ever made . For the 18th-century period film Barry Lyndon ( 1975 ) , Kubrick obtained lenses developed by Zeiss for NASA , to film scenes under natural candlelight . With The Shining ( 1980 ) , he became one of the first directors to make use of a Steadicam for stabilized and fluid tracking shots . While many of Kubrick 's films were controversial and initially received mixed reviews upon release -- particularly A Clockwork Orange ( 1971 ) , which Kubrick pulled from circulation in the UK following a mass media frenzy -- most were nominated for Oscars , Golden Globes , or BAFTA Awards , and underwent critical reevaluations . His last film , Eyes Wide Shut , was completed shortly before his death in 1999 at the age of 70 ."}
{"_id":"Starrcade","title":"Starrcade","text":"Starrcade was an annual professional wrestling event , originally broadcast via closed-circuit television and eventually broadcast via pay-per-view television , held from 1983 to 2000 by the National Wrestling Alliance ( NWA ) and later World Championship Wrestling ( WCW ) . Starrcade was regarded by the NWA and WCW as their flagship event of the year , much in the same vein that its rival , the World Wrestling Entertainment , regards WrestleMania . As a result , the buildup to each Starrcade featured the largest feuds of the promotion .   From 1983 to 1987 , Starrcade was produced by Jim Crockett Promotions ( JCP ) , the dominant promotion of the NWA , and aired on Thanksgiving Day . In 1987 , the WWF scheduled a pay-per-view of their own , Survivor Series , on Thanksgiving night and demanded exclusivity from cable providers on carriage of the event . In order to prevent such a problem , Starrcade was moved to December the following year and the show was held around Christmas Day , mostly in the days following , beginning in 1988 .   Also in 1988 , JCP was sold to Turner Broadcasting due to financial problems and became WCW , though Starrcade was held under the NWA banner until 1990 .   From the 1960s to the 1980s , it was tradition for JCP to hold major professional wrestling events on Thanksgiving and Christmas , mostly at Greensboro Coliseum . In 1983 , JCP created Starrcade as their supercard to continue the Thanksgiving tradition , and spread it across its territory on closed-circuit television . It popularized broadcasting on closed-circuit television and was financially successful . From 1987 , Starrcade was broadcast on pay-per-view , the first NWA event to do so .   The rights to the event now belong to WWE ( formerly the World Wrestling Federation ) . In November 2008 , WWE 24\/7 Classics aired a special as a celebration of the 25th anniversary of the event called The Essential Starrcade . This five-part series counts down the top 25 matches in Starrcade history . In January 2009 , WWE Home Video released Starrcade : The Essential Collection as a three disc DVD set .

{"_id":"Taiwan","title":"Taiwan","text":"Taiwan ( -LSB- ta\u026a\u02c8w\u0251\u02d0n -RSB- ) , officially the Republic of China ( ROC ) , is a state in East Asia . Its neighbours include China ( officially the People 's Republic of China , PRC ) to the west , Japan to the northeast , and the Philippines to the south .  Taiwan is the most populous state that is not a member of the United Nations , and also possesses the largest economy of any state outside of the UN .   The island of Taiwan , also known as Formosa , was mainly inhabited by Taiwanese aborigines before the 17th century , when Dutch and Spanish colonies opened the island to Han Chinese immigration . After a brief rule by the Kingdom of Tungning , the island was annexed by the Qing dynasty , the last dynasty of China . The Qing ceded Taiwan to Japan in 1895 after the Sino-Japanese War . While Taiwan was under Japanese rule , the Republic of China ( ROC ) was established on the mainland in 1912 after the fall of the Qing dynasty . Following the Japanese surrender to the Allies in 1945 , the ROC took control of Taiwan . However , the resumption of the Chinese Civil War led to the ROC 's loss of the mainland to the Communists , and the flight of the ROC government to Taiwan in 1949 . Although the ROC continued to claim to be the legitimate government of China , its effective jurisdiction since 1949 has been limited to Taiwan and its surrounding islands , with the main island making up 99 % of its de facto territory . As a founding member of the United Nations , the ROC continued to represent China at the United Nations until 1971 , when the PRC assumed China 's seat , causing the ROC to lose its UN membership .   In the early 1960s , Taiwan entered a period of rapid economic growth and industrialization , creating a stable industrial economy . In the 1980s and early 1990s , it changed from a one-party military dictatorship dominated by the Kuomintang to a multi-party democracy with a semi-presidential system . Taiwan is the 22nd-largest economy in the world , and its high-tech industry plays a key role in the global economy . It is ranked highly in terms of freedom of the press , healthcare , public education , economic freedom , and human development . The country benefits from a highly skilled workforce and is among the most highly educated countries in the world with one of the highest percentages of its citizens holding a tertiary education degree .   The PRC has consistently claimed sovereignty over Taiwan and asserted the ROC is no longer in legitimate existence . Under its One-China Policy the PRC refused diplomatic relations with any country that recognizes the ROC . Today only a few smaller nations recognize the ROC as the sole legal representative of China , but many other states maintain unofficial ties through representative offices and institutions that function as de facto embassies and consulates . Although Taiwan is fully self-governing , most international organizations in which the PRC participates either refuse to grant membership to Taiwan or allow it to participate only as a non-state actor . Internally , the major division in politics is between the aspirations of eventual Chinese unification or Taiwanese independence , though both sides have moderated their positions to broaden their appeal . The PRC has threatened the use of military force in response to any formal declaration of independence by Taiwan or if PRC leaders decide that peaceful unification is no longer possible ."}

Tennessee is the 36th largest and the 16th most populous of the 50 United States . Tennessee is bordered by Kentucky and Virginia to the north , North Carolina to the east , Georgia , Alabama , and Mississippi to the south , and Arkansas and Missouri to the west . The Appalachian Mountains dominate the eastern part of the state , and the Mississippi River forms the state 's western border . Nashville is the state 's largest city , with a population of 660,388 . Tennessee 's second largest city is Memphis , which has a population of 652,717 .   The state of Tennessee is rooted in the Watauga Association , a 1772 frontier pact generally regarded as the first constitutional government west of the Appalachians . What is now Tennessee was initially part of North Carolina , and later part of the Southwest Territory . Tennessee was admitted to the Union as the 16th state on June 1 , 1796 . Tennessee was the last state to leave the Union and join the Confederacy at the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861 . Occupied by Union forces from 1862 , it was the first state to be readmitted to the Union at the end of the war .   Tennessee furnished more soldiers for the Confederate Army than any other state besides Virginia , and more soldiers for the Union Army than the rest of the Confederacy combined . Beginning during Reconstruction , it had competitive party politics , but a Democratic takeover in the late 1880s resulted in passage of disfranchisement laws that excluded most blacks and many poor whites from voting . This sharply reduced competition in politics in the state until after passage of civil rights legislation in the mid-20th century . In the 20th century , Tennessee transitioned from an agrarian economy to a more diversified economy , aided by massive federal investment in the Tennessee Valley Authority and , in the early 1940s , the city of Oak Ridge . This city was established to house the Manhattan Project 's uranium enrichment facilities , helping to build the world 's first atomic bomb , which was used during World War II .   Tennessee 's major industries include agriculture , manufacturing , and tourism . Poultry , soybeans , and cattle are the state 's primary agricultural products , and major manufacturing exports include chemicals , transportation equipment , and electrical equipment . The Great Smoky Mountains National Park , the nation 's most visited national park , is headquartered in the eastern part of the state , and a section of the Appalachian Trail roughly follows the Tennessee-North Carolina border . Other major tourist attractions include the Tennessee Aquarium in Chattanooga ; Dollywood in Pigeon Forge ; Ripley 's Aquarium of the Smokies and Ober Gatlinburg in Gatlinburg ; the Parthenon , the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum , and Ryman Auditorium in Nashville ; the Jack Daniel 's Distillery in Lynchburg ; Elvis Presley 's Graceland residence and tomb , the Memphis Zoo , and the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis ; and Bristol Motor Speedway in Bristol ."}

{"_id":"Thunderstorm","title":"Thunderstorm","text":"A thunderstorm , also known as an electrical storm , lightning storm , or thundershower , is a storm characterized by the presence of lightning and its acoustic effect on the Earth 's atmosphere , known as thunder . Thunderstorms occur in association with a type of cloud known as a cumulonimbus . They are usually accompanied by strong winds , heavy rain , and sometimes snow , sleet , hail , or , in contrast , no precipitation at all . Thunderstorms may line up in a series or become a rainband , known as a squall line . Strong or severe thunderstorms , known as supercells , rotate as do cyclones . While most thunderstorms move with the mean wind flow through the layer of the troposphere that they occupy , vertical wind shear sometimes causes a deviation in their course at a right angle to the wind shear direction .   Thunderstorms result from the rapid upward movement of warm , moist air , sometimes along a front . As the warm , moist air moves upward , it cools , condenses , and forms a cumulonimbus cloud that can reach heights of over 20 km . As the rising air reaches its dew point temperature , water vapor condenses into water droplets or ice , reducing pressure locally within the thunderstorm cell . Any precipitation falls the long distance through the clouds towards the Earth 's surface . As the droplets fall , they collide with other droplets and become larger . The falling droplets create a downdraft as it pulls cold air with it , and this cold air spreads out at the Earth 's surface , occasionally causing strong winds that are commonly associated with thunderstorms .   Thunderstorms can form and develop in any geographic location but most frequently within the mid-latitude , where warm , moist air from tropical latitudes collides with cooler air from polar latitudes . Thunderstorms are responsible for the development and formation of many severe weather phenomena . Thunderstorms , and the phenomena that occur along with them , pose great hazards . Damage that results from thunderstorms is mainly inflicted by downburst winds , large hailstones , and flash flooding caused by heavy precipitation . Stronger thunderstorm cells are capable of producing tornadoes and waterspouts .   There are four types of thunderstorms : single-cell , multi-cell cluster , multi-cell lines , and supercells . Supercell thunderstorms are the strongest and the most associated with severe weather phenomena . Mesoscale convective systems formed by favorable vertical wind shear within the tropics and subtropics can be responsible for the development of hurricanes . Dry thunderstorms , with no precipitation , can cause the outbreak of wildfires from the heat generated from the cloud-to-ground lightning that accompanies them .

As the founder of the Timurid Empire in Persia and Central Asia he became the first ruler in the Timurid dynasty .   Born into the Barlas confederation in Transoxiana on 9 April 1336 , Timur gained control of the western Chagatai Khanate by 1370 . From that base he led military campaigns across Western , South and Central Asia , the Caucasus and southern Russia , and emerged as the most powerful ruler in the Muslim world after defeating the Mamluks of Egypt and Syria , the emerging Ottoman Empire , and the declining Delhi Sultanate . From these conquests he founded the Timurid Empire , but this empire fragmented shortly after his death .   Timur is considered the last of the great nomadic conquerors of the Eurasian Steppe , and his empire set the stage for the rise of the more structured and lasting Gunpowder Empires in the 1500s and 1600s . According to John Joseph Saunders , Timur 's background was Iranized and not steppe nomad .   Timur envisioned the restoration of the Mongol Empire of Genghis Khan ( died 1227 ) . `` In his formal correspondence Temur continued throughout his life to portray himself as the restorer of Chinggisid rights . He justified his Iranian , Mamluk , and Ottoman campaigns as a re-imposition of legitimate Mongol control over lands taken by usurpers . To legitimize his conquests , Timur relied on Islamic symbols and language , referred to himself as the `` Sword of Islam '' , and patronized educational and religious institutions . He converted nearly all the Borjigin leaders to Islam during his lifetime .  `` Temur , a non-Chinggisid , tried to build a double legitimacy based on his role as both guardian and restorer of the Mongol Empire . ''  Timur also decisively defeated the Christian Knights Hospitaller at the Siege of Smyrna , styling himself a ghazi . By the end of his reign , Timur had gained complete control over all the remnants of the Chagatai Khanate , the Ilkhanate , and the Golden Horde , and even attempted to restore the Yuan dynasty in China .   Timur 's armies were inclusively multi-ethnic and were feared throughout Asia , Africa , and Europe , sizable parts of which his campaigns laid to waste . Scholars estimate that his military campaigns caused the deaths of 17 million people , amounting to about 5 % of the world population at the time .   He was the grandfather of the renowned Timurid sultan , astronomer and mathematician Ulugh Beg , who ruled Central Asia from 1411 to 1449 , and the great-great-great-grandfather of Babur ( 1483-1530 ) , founder of the Mughal Empire , which ruled parts of South Asia for over three centuries , from 1526 until 1857 .  Timur is also recognized as a great patron of art and architecture , as he interacted with Muslim intellectuals such as Ibn Khaldun and Hafiz-i Abru ."}

As an industrial and financial center of Mexico , Tijuana exerts a strong influence on economics , education , culture , art , and politics . As the city has become a leading center in the country , so has the surrounding metropolitan area , a major industrial and paramount metropolis in northwestern Mexico . Currently one of the fastest growing metropolitan areas in Mexico , Tijuana maintains global city status . , the city of Tijuana had a population of 1,696,923 .   Tijuana is located on the Gold Coast of Baja California , and is the municipal seat and cultural and commercial center of Tijuana Municipality . Tijuana covers 70 % of the municipality but contains over 80 % of its population . A dominant manufacturing center of the North American continent , the city maintains facilities of many multinational conglomerate companies . In the early 21st century , Tijuana became the medical-device manufacturing capital of North America . Tijuana is also a growing cultural center and has been recognized as an important new cultural mecca . The city is the most visited border city in the globe ; sharing a border of about 24 km with its sister city San Diego . More than fifty million people cross the border between these two cities every year . This metropolitan crossing makes the San Ysidro Port of Entry the busiest land-border crossing in the world . It is estimated that the two border crossing stations between the cities proper of San Diego and Tijuana account for 300,000 daily border crossings alone .   Tijuana is the 45th largest city in the Americas and is the westernmost city in Mexico . According to the 2010 census , the Tijuana metropolitan area was the fifth-largest in Mexico , with a population of 1,784,034 , but rankings vary , the city ( locality ) itself was 6th largest and the municipality ( administrative ) 3rd largest nationally . The international metropolitan region was estimated to be just over five million in 2009 and about 5,105,769 in 2010 , making it the third largest metropolitan area in the former Californias region , 19th largest metropolitan area in the Americas , and the largest bi-national conurbation that is shared between US and Mexico . Tijuana is becoming more suburbanized like San Diego ; during the 2000s the drug violence had residents moving out of the congested urban core into isolated communities within the municipality and beyond , as evidenced by 2010 Census figures and growth patterns .   Tijuana traces its modern history to the arrival of Spanish explorers in the 16th century who were mapping the coast of the Californias . As the American conquest of northern Mexico ended with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo , Tijuana 's new international position on the border gave rise to a new economic and political structure . The city was founded in July 11 , 1889 as urban development began . Often known by its initials , T.J. , and nicknamed Gateway to Mexico , the city has historically served as a tourist center dating back to the 1880s ."}

The stalemate situation in the early part of the war led to the deployment of tunnel warfare . After the first German Empire attacks on 21 December 1914 , through shallow tunnels underneath no man 's land and exploding ten mines under the trenches of the Indian Sirhind Brigade , the British began forming suitable units . In February 1915 , eight Tunnelling Companies were created and operational in Flanders from March 1915 . By mid-1916 , the British Army had around 25,000 trained tunnellers , mostly volunteers taken from coal mining communities . Almost twice that number of `` attached infantry '' worked permanently alongside the trained miners acting as ` beasts of burden ' .   From the spring of 1917 the whole war became more mobile , with grand offensives at Arras , Messines and Passchendaele . There was no longer a place for a tactic that depended upon total stasis for its employment . The tactics and counter-tactics required deeper and deeper tunnelling , hence more time and more stable front lines were also required , so offensive and defensive military mining largely ceased . Underground work continued , with the tunnellers concentrating on deep dugouts for troop accommodation , a tactic used particularly in the Battle of Arras ."}

{"_id":"Uranium","title":"Uranium","text":"Uranium is a chemical element with symbol U and atomic number 92 . It is a silvery-white metal in the actinide series of the periodic table . A uranium atom has 92 protons and 92 electrons , of which 6 are valence electrons . Uranium is weakly radioactive because all its isotopes are unstable ( with half-lives of the six naturally known isotopes , uranium-233 to uranium-238 , varying between 69 years and 4.5 billion years ) . The most common isotopes in natural uranium are uranium-238 ( which has 146 neutrons and accounts for over 99 % ) and uranium-235 ( which has 143 neutrons ) . Uranium has the highest atomic weight of the primordially occurring elements . Its density is about 70 % higher than that of lead , and slightly lower than that of gold or tungsten . It occurs naturally in low concentrations of a few parts per million in soil , rock and water , and is commercially extracted from uranium-bearing minerals such as uraninite .   In nature , uranium is found as uranium-238 ( 99.2739 -- 99.2752 % ) , uranium-235 ( 0.7198 -- 0.7202 % ) , and a very small amount of uranium-234 ( 0.0050 -- 0.0059 % ) . Uranium decays slowly by emitting an alpha particle . The half-life of uranium-238 is about 4.47 billion years and that of uranium-235 is 704 million years , making them useful in dating the age of the Earth .   Many contemporary uses of uranium exploit its unique nuclear properties . Uranium-235 is the only naturally occurring fissile isotope , which makes it widely used in nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons . However , because of the tiny amounts found in nature , uranium needs to undergo enrichment so that enough uranium-235 is present . Uranium-238 is fissionable by fast neutrons , and is fertile , meaning it can be transmuted to fissile plutonium-239 in a nuclear reactor . Another fissile isotope , uranium-233 , can be produced from natural thorium and is also important in nuclear technology . Uranium-238 has a small probability for spontaneous fission or even induced fission with fast neutrons ; uranium-235 and to a lesser degree uranium-233 have a much higher fission cross-section for slow neutrons . In sufficient concentration , these isotopes maintain a sustained nuclear chain reaction . This generates the heat in nuclear power reactors , and produces the fissile material for nuclear weapons . Depleted uranium ( 238U ) is used in kinetic energy penetrators and armor plating . Uranium is used as a colorant in uranium glass , producing lemon yellow to green colors . Uranium glass fluoresces green in ultraviolet light . It was also used for tinting and shading in early photography .   The 1789 discovery of uranium in the mineral pitchblende is credited to Martin Heinrich Klaproth , who named the new element after the planet Uranus . Eug\u00e8ne-Melchior P\u00e9ligot was the first person to isolate the metal and its radioactive properties were discovered in 1896 by Henri Becquerel . Research by Otto Hahn , Lise Meitner , Enrico Fermi and others , such as J. Robert Oppenheimer starting in 1934 led to its use as a fuel in the nuclear power industry and in Little Boy , the first nuclear weapon used in war . An ensuing arms race during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union produced tens of thousands of nuclear weapons that used uranium metal and uranium-derived plutonium-239 . The security of those weapons and their fissile material following the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 is an ongoing concern for public health and safety . See Nuclear proliferation ."}

The state is part of both the Southern United States , as well as the Mid-Atlantic . Virginia is nicknamed the `` Old Dominion '' due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America , and `` Mother of Presidents '' because eight U.S. presidents were born there , more than any other state . The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay , which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna . The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond ; Virginia Beach is the most populous city , and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision . The Commonwealth 's estimated population is over 8.3 million .   The area 's history begins with several indigenous groups , including the Powhatan . In 1607 the London Company established the Colony of Virginia as the first permanent New World English colony . Slave labor and the land acquired from displaced Native American tribes each played a significant role in the colony 's early politics and plantation economy . Virginia was one of the 13 Colonies in the American Revolution and joined the Confederacy in the American Civil War , during which Richmond was made the Confederate capital and Virginia 's northwestern counties seceded to form the state of West Virginia . Although the Commonwealth was under one-party rule for nearly a century following Reconstruction , both major national parties are competitive in modern Virginia .   The Virginia General Assembly is the oldest continuous law-making body in the New World . The state government was ranked most effective by the Pew Center on the States in both 2005 and 2008 . It is unique in how it treats cities and counties equally , manages local roads , and prohibits its governors from serving consecutive terms . Virginia 's economy has many sectors : agriculture in the Shenandoah Valley ; federal agencies in Northern Virginia , including the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense and Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) ; and military facilities in Hampton Roads , the site of the region 's main seaport . Virginia 's economy changed from primarily agricultural to industrial during the 1960s and 1970s , and in 2002 computer chips became the state 's leading export by monetary value ."}

It is the tallest monumental column in the world if all are measured above their pedestrian entrances .   Construction of the monument began in 1848 , and was halted from 1854 to 1877 due to a lack of funds , a struggle for control over the Washington National Monument Society , and the intervention of the American Civil War . Although the stone structure was completed in 1884 , internal ironwork , the knoll , and other finishing touches were not completed until 1888 . A difference in shading of the marble , visible approximately 150 ft or 27 % up , shows where construction was halted and later resumed with marble from a different source . The original design was by Robert Mills , but he did not include his proposed colonnade due to a lack of funds , proceeding only with a bare obelisk . Despite many proposals to embellish the obelisk , only its original flat top was altered to a pointed marble pyramidion , in 1884 . The cornerstone was laid on July 4 , 1848 ; the first stone was laid atop the unfinished stump on ; the capstone was set on ; the completed monument was dedicated on ; and officially opened . Upon completion , it became the world 's tallest structure , a title previously held by the Cologne Cathedral . The monument held this designation until 1889 , when the Eiffel Tower was completed in Paris , France .   The monument was damaged during the 2011 Virginia earthquake and Hurricane Irene in the same year and remained closed to the public while the structure was assessed and repaired .

It is bordered by Virginia to the southeast , Kentucky to the southwest , Ohio to the northwest , Pennsylvania to the north ( and , slightly , east ) , and Maryland to the northeast . West Virginia is the 9th smallest by area , is ranked 38th in population , and has the second lowest household income of the 50 United States . The capital and largest city is Charleston .   West Virginia became a state following the Wheeling Conventions of 1861 , in which delegates from some Unionist counties of northwestern Virginia decided to break away from Virginia during the American Civil War , although they included many secessionist counties in the new state . West Virginia was admitted to the Union on June 20 , 1863 , and was a key Civil War border state . West Virginia was the only state to form by separating from a Confederate state , the first to separate from any state since Maine separated from Massachusetts , and was one of two states formed during the American Civil War ( the other being Nevada ) .   The Census Bureau and the Association of American Geographers classify West Virginia as part of the Southern United States . The northern panhandle extends adjacent to Pennsylvania and Ohio , with the West Virginia cities of Wheeling and Weirton just across the border from the Pittsburgh metropolitan area , while Bluefield is less than 70 mi from North Carolina . Huntington in the southwest is close to the states of Ohio and Kentucky , while Martinsburg and Harpers Ferry in the Eastern Panhandle region are considered part of the Washington metropolitan area , in between the states of Maryland and Virginia . The unique position of West Virginia means that it is often included in several geographical regions , including the Mid-Atlantic , the Upland South , and the Southeastern United States . It is the only state that is entirely within the area served by the Appalachian Regional Commission ; the area is commonly defined as `` Appalachia '' .   The state is noted for its mountains and rolling hills , its historically significant logging and coal mining industries , and its political and labor history . It is one of the most densely karstic areas in the world , making it a choice area for recreational caving and scientific research . The karst lands contribute to much of the state 's cool trout waters . It is also known for a wide range of outdoor recreational opportunities , including skiing , whitewater rafting , fishing , hiking , backpacking , mountain biking , rock climbing , and hunting ."}

It came into existence after World War I in 1918 under the name of the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes by the merger of the provisional State of Slovenes , Croats and Serbs ( itself formed from territories of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire ) with the formerly independent Kingdom of Serbia . The Serbian royal House of Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 became the Yugoslav royal dynasty . Yugoslavia gained international recognition on 13 July 1922 at the Conference of Ambassadors in Paris . The country was named after the South Slavic peoples and constituted their first union , following centuries in which the territories had been part of the Ottoman Empire and Austria-Hungary .   Renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia on 3 October 1929 , it was invaded by the Axis powers on 6 April 1941 . In 1943 , a Democratic Federal Yugoslavia was proclaimed by the Partisan resistance . In 1944 , the king recognised it as the legitimate government , but in November 1945 the monarchy was abolished . Yugoslavia was renamed the Federal People 's Republic of Yugoslavia in 1946 , when a communist government was established . It acquired the territories of Istria , Rijeka , and Zadar from Italy . Partisan leader Josip Broz Tito ruled the country as president until his death in 1980 . In 1963 , the country was renamed again as the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( SFRY ) .   The constituent six socialist republics that made up the country were the SR Bosnia and Herzegovina , SR Croatia , SR Macedonia , SR Montenegro , SR Serbia , and SR Slovenia . Serbia contained two Socialist Autonomous Provinces , Vojvodina and Kosovo , which after 1974 were largely equal to the other members of the federation . After an economic and political crisis in the 1980s and the rise of nationalism , Yugoslavia broke up along its republics ' borders , at first into five countries , leading to the Yugoslav Wars .   After the breakup , the republics of Serbia and Montenegro formed a reduced federation , the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( FRY ) , which aspired to the status of sole legal successor to the SFRY , but those claims were opposed by the other former republics . Eventually , Serbia and Montenegro accepted the opinion of the Badinter Arbitration Committee about shared succession . Serbia and Montenegro themselves broke up in 2006 and became independent states , while Kosovo proclaimed independence in 2008 ."}
